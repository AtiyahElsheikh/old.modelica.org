<h2><a name="letter">New Modelica Association Board</a></h2>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
Dear Modelica interested,</p>
<p>
At the Modelica Association Meeting on Feb. 29, 2012, the new
<a href="#">MA Bylaws</a> were approved. As indicated in the last newsletter, as a result the working process of the Modelica Association will be changed and long term development activities will now be organized in MA Projects (MAPs). MAPs operate under their own rules and MAP members need not be members of the Modelica Association, with exception of the MAP leader.</p>
<p>
At the last Modelica Association Meeting on May 8, 2012, the following three MAPs and their rules have been approved (for more details, see the
<a href="../../../projects.html">MAP description</a>):</p>
<table class="vertical listing">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Modelica Language</strong><br />
               Further development of the Modelica language.
              This MAP is headed by Martin Otter from DLR-RMC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Modelica Libraries</strong><br />
             Further development of the Modelica Standard Library 
             (and other free libraries from the Modelica Association).
            This MAP is headed by Anton Haumer from AIT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <strong>Functional Mockup Interface</strong><br />
              Further development of the FMI standard,
               especially for model exchange and co-simulation.
               This MAP is headed by Torsten Blochwitz from ITI.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
At the last meeting, also a new Modelica Association Board has been elected for the next 
two years. In order to enhance und improve strategic topics, the MA Board has been extended with new positions:</p>
<table class="vertical listing">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Chairperson</strong></td>
<td>Martin Otter (DLR-RMC, Oberpfaffenhofen)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Vice-Chairperson</strong></td>
<td>Peter Fritzson (Linköping University, Linköping)</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Secretary</strong></td>
<td>Michael Tiller (Dassault Systèmes, Velicy)</td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Treasurer</strong></td>
<td>Jonas Eborn (Modelon AB, Lund)</td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Marketing</strong></td>
<td>Hubertus Tummescheit (Modelon AB, Lund)</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
The MAP leaders are included in the MA Board in order that all relevant information is distributed between all parts of MA, and in order that all the different MA parts can influence and participate on overall decisions. The other three new positions have the following tasks:</p>
<table class="vertical listing">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Marketing</strong></td>
<td>Responsible for marketing the results of the MA projects, in particular, 
              to position Modelica and FMI as a leading brand in modeling and simulation 
              technology. This implies organizing and promoting articles in journals and 
              magazines, advertising, and advertising material (flyers, posters, videos, 
              Google ads, web pages, ...).</td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Quality and Processes</strong></td>
<td>Improve the processes of the MA projects for the purpose of improving quality 
              of the project results, in particular for the Modelica language specification, the
              Modelica libraries and FMI. Furthermore, setting up testing processes regarding
              regression, interoperability and conformance to the standards. This implies also 
              organizing externally paid work for these topics.</td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Technology</strong></td>
<td>To provide technical guidance and coordination to the MA projects in 
              order that coherent technology is used and developed in the MA projects.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
We expect that these changes will considerably improve the already successful 
operation of the Modelica Association in the future. Note, the MA Board can be
reached via its email address <a href="mailto:board@Modelica.org">board@Modelica.org</a>.</p>
<p>
If you have interesting news for the Modelica community, please contact the newsletter editor (<a href="mailto:newsletter@modelica.org">Michael Tiller</a>) for information on how to submit newsletter articles for possible inclusion in the next newsletter. The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is <strong>Oct. 15, 2012</strong>.</p>

<h2><a name="item129">Modelica 3.3 Released</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/StateMachine.png" alt="Modelica 3.3 Released" />
<p>
The new version 3.3 of the Modelica language was released on May 9, 2012. The specification document is available <a href="http://www.modelica.org/documents/ModelicaSpec33.pdf">here in pdf format</a>. This release is backwards compatible to the previous 3.2 release. The essential changes with respect to 3.2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Synchronous language elements</strong><br />
       Language elements have been added to describe synchronous behavior
       suited for implementation of control systems. For this, a new base type "Clock" is introduced
       to describe the ticking of periodic and non-periodic sampled data systems, with
       the ability to precisely define time synchronization via sub-, super-, and shift-sampling.
       Clocked variables and equations are now uniquely associated with one clock, mostly
       automatically via clock inference (e.g., if a variable in one equation belongs to a clock,
       then all variables in this equation, and the equation itself belong to this clock as well).
       These synchronous language elements allow many more checks at compile time and
       therefore lead to increased correctness of control systems implementation with
       respect to previous Modelica releases. Furthermore, full equations can now be
       used in sampled data systems, and continuous-time equations can be automatically
       discretized and transformed to clocked equations (e.g., as before, a non-linear 
       continuous-time model of a plant can be automatically inverted for a feedforward
       control partition but can now, with Modelica 3.3, be transformed to a 
       discrete-time partition that can be directly utilized in an embedded system).
       </li>

<li> <strong>State machines</strong><br />
       Language elements have been added to define state machines (see figure).
       These state machines have a similar modeling power as Statecharts, but
       have the important feature that at one clock tick, there is only one assignment to every 
       variable (for example, it is an error if state machines are executed in parallel and they 
       assign to the same variable at the same clock tick; such errors are detected during translation). 
       Furthermore, it is possible to activate and deactivate blocks at a clock tick. 
       The semantics of the state machines is basically those from
       <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/%7Epouzet/lucid-synchrone">Lucid Synchrone 3.0</a> 
      with some Modelica-specific adaptations:
       (note, safety critical control software in aircraft are often defined with such kinds
       of state machines): <br /> 
Any block instance without continuous behavior can be used as a state of a state machine. A transition is introduced as a new kind of coupling between states. A set of block instances coupled by transitions form a state machine. One of the blocks is marked as initial state. State machines can be hierarchical and can exist in parallel. A transition has an associated transition condition. When a state is activated, all its hierarchical subcomponents are activated and vice versa. A transition has a reset attribute which states, when enabled, that after such a transition is made, the destination state is reset meaning that all sub-state machines are restarted in their initial state and all state variables are reset to their start values. Special semantic rules are introduced to maintain the single assignment rule of Modelica by analyzing that multiple assignments can only occur in mutually exclusive states of the same state machine. A similar rule is introduced to allow several mutually exclusive sources of data in the block diagram.
</li>

<li> <strong>New built-in operator spatialDistribution</strong><br />
       This operator allows the description of one-dimensional plug-flow and other applications
       which involve the modeling of variable-speed transport of properties.
       One option to model this infinite-dimensional system
       is to approximate it by differential equations, but this requires a large number of state variables
       and 
       might introduce either numerical diffusion or numerical oscillations. This new built-in operator 
       keeps track of the spatial distribution of z(y, t), by suitable sampling, interpolation, and shifting
       of the stored distribution. In this case, the internal state of the operator is hidden from the
       integrator.</li>

<li> <strong>New built-in operator getInstanceName</strong> <br />
       This operator allows models to access the actual name of each instance. Typical use is in
       diagnostic messages, in order to more precisely define in which part of the model
       an issue occurred.</li>

<li> Many additional smaller improvements. For details, see Appendix E.1 of the specification.</li></ul>

<p>
The <a href="../../../events/modelica2012.html">9th International Modelica
Conference</a> will be held in Munich, Germany on 
<strong>September 3 - 5, 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>
What follows is a summary of the event (see the complete <a href="../../../events/modelica2012/Conference&#32;Program/Preliminary&#32;Program.html">preliminary program of the conference</a>
for more details).</p>
<p>
The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and 
language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and 
industrial progress related to Modelica, to the Modelica Association and to 
the <a href="http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/">Functional Mockup Interface</a>. 
The last Modelica conference in 2011 was visited by 325 participants from 23 countries, and
we expect a similar size at this conference. Highlights of the Conference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> 80 regular</strong> papers and <strong>23 poster</strong> papers</li>
<li><strong>8  tutorials</strong>
       (3.5 hours each, <a href="../../../events/modelica2012/tutorials/tutorials.html">descriptions</a>)</li>
<li><strong>10 vendor sessions</strong> (45 min. each) where the latest news of Modelica and FMI tools are
       presented</li>
<li> <a href="../../../events/modelica2012/exhibitors.html"><strong>16
       exhibitors</strong></a> in the exhibition area</li></ul>
<p>
Note, the deadline for early 
<a href="../../../events/modelica2012/registration/index.html">registration</a>
with a reduced fee is
<strong>July 1, 2012.</strong></p>
<p>
The conference is located at the 
<a href="http://www.fuerstenfeld.de/">Veranstaltungsforum Fürstenfeld</a> 
in Fürstenfeldbruck near Munich. This venue was built as annex to an ancient monastery but is fully modernized. Spacious halls enable four parallel sessions and renovation of the historic buildings creates a cozy atmosphere for the associated social events.</p>
<p>
Munich is a city with plenty of attractions. You may taste the Bavarian beer in the English Garden or visit BMW World near the Olympiapark. Fürstenfeldbruck itself is located in the "Fünfseenland" where five beautiful lakes offer a wonderful area for recreation close to nature.</p>

<h2><a name="item130">FMI Compliance Checker</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
In order to ensure consistent implementations of the <a href="http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/">Functional Mock-up Interface</a> (FMI) standard in different tools, the Modelica Association is funding the development of an open source FMI compliance checker. This program checks Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) for compliance to FMI 1.0 and, in a future version, to the upcoming FMI 2.0. The program takes as its input an FMU and validates binary FMUs for Windows and Linux. In particular, the correctness of the XML file and DLL/so functions contained in FMUs are checked, and in addition, the program simulates the FMU with an explicit Euler method and will write a validation report. The compliance checker for FMI 1.0 will be available to the public in mid of July 2012 under the BSD license. The MA thereby expects to simplify the process of detecting whether a tool exports a non-compliant FMU, or a tool cannot simulate a standard compliant FMU, in order to help tool vendors to improve their FMI support.</p>
<p>
Following an open call for quotations resulting in five offers, the MA members decided to accept the offer from <a href="http://www.modelon.com/">Modelon AB</a>, Lund, Sweden, for the implementation.</p>

<h1>Project News</h1>
<br />
<h2><a name="item124">IEA project for building and community energy systems</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
The International Energy Agency, under the implementing agreement on <a href="http://www.ecbcs.org">Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems</a>, approved the five-year Annex 60 proposal "New generation computational tools for building and community energy systems based on the Modelica and Functional Mockup Interface standards." 
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the USA are already expected to participate. Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK are currently in the process of forming a team.</p>
<p> 
The project aims to share, further develop and deploy free open-source contributions of currently uncoordinated activities in modeling and simulation of energy systems of buildings and communities, based on Modelica and Functional Mockup Interface standard. The project will create and validate tool-chains that link Building Information Models to energy modeling, building simulation to controls design tools, and design tools to operational tools. Invention and deployment of integrated energy-related systems and performance-based solutions for buildings and communities will be accelerated by extending, unifying and documenting existing Modelica libraries, by providing technical capabilities to link existing building performance simulation tools with such libraries and other tools through the Functional Mockup Interface standard. The technology will allow optimized design, analysis and operation of multi-domain systems as posed by building and community energy systems.

<h2><a name="item133">DYNCAP - Modelling and Simulating the Dynamics of CO2 Capture</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
Capturing the dynamics of power plant processes is getting into the focus of energy providers, power plant suppliers and grid operators all over the world. the reason for this trend is the increasing capacity of fluctuating renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy, which is especially challenging in small markets and isolated networks. In this context, system simulation can help to increase the load following capacity of power units by optimization of both, the control systems and the process set-up. 
As part of the German research project DYNCAP the Modelica library ClaRaCCS will be developed. Because the energy and mass storage of fuel preparation and steam generation is essential for process evaluation and control optimization, ClaRaCCS will provide models of different complexity for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coal mills featuring classifier-dependent mass and energy storage</li>
<li>Burners and flame rooms featuring stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric combustion and heat transfer due to convection and radiation</li>
<li>Pipes, heat exchangers and spray injectors including transmission line-based approaches for long connection pipes</li>
<li>Walls and headers in order capture the heat capacities of thick-walled components allowing analysis of thermally induced wear</li>
<li>Applying this set of basic components various steam generator configurations can be defined and used for detailed analysis of transients.</li></ul>
<p>
The development of ClaRaCCS is carried out in cooperation with <a href="http://www.tu-harburg.de/index_e.html">Hamburg University of Technology</a>, <a href="http://tlk-thermo.com/index.php?lang=en">TLK-Thermo GmbH</a> and <a href="http://www.xrg-simulation.de/en">XRG Simulation GmbH</a>. The research project DYNCAP is funded by Germany's Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Reference number 03ET2009), started in March 2011 and will end in August 2014. The resulting Modelica library will be made freely available.</p>

<p>
ITI has published a new Modelica based library package for simulating energy efficient buildings. The package helps to calculate the optimal use of energy resources and decentralized energy storage. The simulation enables significant optimization of local energy systems.</p>
<p>
The integrated concept of SimulationX allows for the simulation of all energy flows in one system taking not only the building itself into account, but also the inhabitants’ behavior and additional consumption, e.g. electric vehicles. The calculation is based on specific input data, such as local weather conditions, battery size, energy prices and the inhabitants’ life style. The ready-to-use elements are grounded on real-world data. Additionally, a variety of input data can be specified individually, e.g. consumer demands, and electric mobility.</p>
<p>
Thanks to phenomenological models, parameters are easy to use, and modeling is intuitively understandable. Neither is it necessary to formulate further differential equations or complex control strategies, nor do real systems have to be abstracted as mathematical calculation models.</p>
<p>
Basic element categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>ambient conditions</li>
<li>thermal plugs and electrical plugs</li>
<li>stationary battery and heat storage</li>
<li>vehicle</li>
<li>building</li>
<li>heating system and domestic water supply</li>
<li>combined heat and power unit, condensing boiler</li>
<li>heat pump and solar thermal</li>
<li>micro wind and photovoltaics</li></ul>
<p>
Simulations allow dynamic stress tests and cost calculations. Engineers are able to compare different system configurations, e.g. regarding energy and life cycle costs (incl. investment, consumption, subsidies, degradation and maintenance). The system layout can be used as plant model for testing energy management algorithms during a simulation.</p>
<p>
The COM interface provides access to external controls and efficient post processing options. Consequently, huge datasets from long-term measurements can be reduced and calculations accelerated.</p>

<h2><a name="item127">FMI Library 1.0</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p><a href="http://www.jmodelica.org/FMILibrary">FMI Library</a> (FMIL) is a software package written in C that enables integration of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) import in applications. The package provides a C API for interacting with all parts of FMUs, including unzipping, loading of shared object files (DLLs) contained in FMUs, as well as parsing of XML model metadata files. The user is thereby relieved from managing the details of FMU interaction, which significantly reduce the time required to implement FMU import capabilities.</p>
<p>FMI Library is suitable in contexts where FMUs need to be integrated in existing applications or in custom software projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Full support for FMI for Model Exchange 1.0</li>
	<li>
		Full support for FMI for Co-simulation 1.0</li>
	<li>
		A unified C API encapsulating all parts of the FMU interaction, including ZIP, DLL and XML management</li>
	<li>
		Build system based on CMake, enabling generation of native build scripts (MSVC on Windows, GCC on Linux)</li>
	<li>
		Extensive API documentation in HTML format</li></ul>
<p>FMI Library is the basis of the official FMI Compliance Checker (available summer 2012) provided by the Modelica Association.</p>
<p>FMI Library is released under the BSD license.</p>

<h2><a name="item135">Advanced Interpolation with OpenModelica 1.8.1</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/ncDataReader2access-400x265.png" alt="Advanced Interpolation with OpenModelica 1.8.1" />
<p>
OpenModelica is an open-source model-based cyber-physical mathematical modeling,
architectural description, and simulation environment
intended for industrial and academic usage. 
Its long-term development is supported by a non-profit organization - 
the Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC),
 <a href="http://www.openmodelica.org">www.openmodelica.org</a>.</p>
<p>
The advanced interpolation and data access package 
<a href="http://j-raedler.de/projects/ncDataReader2">ncDataReader2</a>
is available for easy usage from Modelica models together with OpenModelica 1.8.1. 

This offers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is very fast, even with large amounts of data. For example, a test application with 
OpenModelica on an 840 MB data file including initialization, data reading, one million 
interpolations, numerical integration and writing of the results finished in 5 seconds on a 
standard dual-core laptop.</li>
<li>Several interpolation and extrapolation methods are included such as Akima (cubic), linear, 
discrete, and smoothed steps.</li>
<li>Load on demand, intelligent tunable caching mechanism, offset and scaling of values for unit 
conversion and memory-efficient storage.</li>
<li>Data can be accesses either locally from a file or via a URI from a server using the highly 
efficient DAP network protocol.</li>
<li>Possiblity of easy access to the same data source by several simulation applications.</li></ul>
<p>
The ncDataReader2 has been used, evaluated, and adapted for use with OpenModelica by Christoph 
Nytsch-Geusen et al in the context of the BuildingSystems application library. It can be used with OpenModelica 1.8.1 but is
not part of that release.</p>
<p>
The OpenModelica development work is organized by the expanding Open Source Modelica Consortium,
currently 43 organizations.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="item109">Maplesoft Adds Consulting Services to its Portfolio</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/MaplesoftConsulting_modelica.png" alt="Maplesoft Adds Consulting Services to its Portfolio" />
<p><a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/">Maplesoft</a> has announced the addition of <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/products/proservices/">professional consulting services</a> to strengthen its portfolio of offerings for system-level modeling and simulation. Maplesoft consultants are available to help engineers reduce development time and risk, as well as create better products.</p>
<p>Maplesoft has <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/products/maplesim/gallery/">extensive expertise in system-level modeling and simulation</a>, covering a wide range of applications and industries. Maplesoft’s Modelica-based consulting services include model development and simulation services, analysis and tool development, real-time plant-model code generation, and training. Maplesoft specializes in the modeling, simulation, and optimization of complex multidomain systems.  Consultants will draw on the expertise gained from past and current consulting projects, which include the development of a specialized driveline component library, multiple projects with a leading automotive manufacturer to help them move to a model-based development process, the development of battery models for EV and HEV systems, vibration analysis of drivetrain models for marine drivelines,  and multiple projects involving the development of custom components and solutions in the areas of robotics, mechatronics, motion control, aerospace, power and energy.</p>
<p>The open, object-oriented, physical modeling language, Modelica, is at the core of most of Maplesoft’s development projects. Modelica-based tools have experienced wide-spread adoption over the past two decades. Maplesoft is committed to supporting the Modelica open standard and the development of a common pool of knowledge that can assist engineering organizations to efficiently develop innovative processes and products that will ultimately benefit everyone. Because Modelica components have been developed and validated by industry, engineers can have confidence that their models will provide an accurate representation of the system.</p>
<p>“For some time now, our customers have been telling us that they have gaps in their resources when it comes to implementing system-level modeling and simulation projects, and this initiative is a direct response to that request,” said Paul Goossens, Vice President, Applications Engineering, Maplesoft. “We believe our Modelica-based expertise will help customers with the smooth implementation of modeling strategies, reduce risk of project slip or failure, and maximize return on investment.”</p>
<p>Maplesoft uses the Modelica-based modeling tool <a href="http://www.maplesim.com/">MapleSim</a> for most development projects, though they also offer expertise in other tools. The combination of Modelica’s system-level modeling language with the symbolic computational power of MapleSim enables a level of understanding, power, and extensibility that is not possible with “black-box” tools. Through its advanced automatic code-generation technologies, Maplesoft can help deploy models to the rest of the toolchain, including in-house tools, MATLAB® and Simulink®, optimization tools, co-simulation platforms, and real-time systems for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.</p>
