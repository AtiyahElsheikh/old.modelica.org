<h2><a name="letter">Letter from the Board</a></h2>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
Dear Modelica and FMI interested,</p>
<p>
The Modelica Association continues its successful conferences on Modelica and FMI: The 11th International Modelica Conference will take place on <strong>Sept. 21-23, 2015</strong> near <strong>Paris</strong>. For more details, <a href="index_html.html#item323">see below</a>.</p>
<p>
The Modelica Association board was newly elected on June 17, 2014 for the coming two years period. The <a href="https://www.modelica.org/association">new board</a> is identical to the previous board with one exception: There was no applicant for the board position for <em>Quality and Processes</em> and therefore this position is vacant now.</p>
<p>
The adoption of the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard has exceeded our expectations. When I looked today on the <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/tools">FMI Tools Page</a>, 53 tools are listed that support FMI 1.0, and additionally 7 tools are listed that plan to support FMI 1.0. So, FMI is becoming a widely available technology to exchange models. After a tremendous amount of work of the people from the FMI group, the new version 2.0 of FMI was released in July 2014. For more details <a href="index_html.html#item321">see below</a>.</p>
<p>
If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI community, please contact the newsletter editor (<a href="mailto:newsletter@modelica.org">Michael Tiller</a>) for information on how to submit newsletter articles for possible inclusion in the next newsletter. The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is February 15, 2015.</p>

<p>
The Modelica language specification 3.3 Revision 1 was released on July 11, 2014. The specification text 
is available <a href="https://www.modelica.org/documents/ModelicaSpec33Revision1.pdf">here in pdf format</a>.  This version clarifies and fixes issues of the specification text. In particular it includes all updates made in the Modelica language specification 3.2 Revision 2. An overview of the improvements is available <a href="https://www.modelica.org/news_items/release_of_modelica_3_3_revision_1">from here</a>.

<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/FMI_Image.png" alt="FMI 2.0 Released" />
<p>
The Functional Mockup Interface Version 2.0 was released on July 25, 2014. FMI is a tool independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models using a combination of xml-files and C-code (either compiled in DLL/shared libraries or in source code). The first version, FMI 1.0, was published in 2010. Enhancements of FMI 2.0 over FMI 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li> 
FMI for Model Exchange and for Co-Simulation have been merged into one standard. As a consequence, a single FMU (Functional Mockup Unit) can now include both a Model Exchange and a Co-Simulation version of the same model and the decision as to which version to use is only made when instantiating the FMU.</li>
<li>
Many practical issues of FMI 1.0 have been fixed. For example, in Model Exchange there was no standard way to access additional files of an FMU like maps and tables. In FMI 2.0, the absolute path to the directory where these files are locally stored is passed to the FMU. Furthermore, FMUs based on DLLs can have a generic file name in FMI 2.0, in order that one FMU can be used as pure communication unit to any model supported by the underlying co-simulation tool.
</li>
<li>
Parameters can be optionally changed during simulation. This allows for example online-tuning of parameters of a controller.</li>
<li>
The internal FMU state can be optionally saved, restored, and copied into a byte vector. 
It is then possible to save the state of an FMU at a particular time instant during
simulation and continue from this state at any time. Furthermore, this simplifies
the implementation of more advanced master algorithms with variable step size
and error control, by saving the state of a co-simulation slave, and repeating a <code>doStep</code> call
from the original time instant with a smaller step size.
</li>
<li>
The sparse structure of the partial derivatives with respect to continuous-time states and to
inputs can be optionally stored in the xml-file of the FMU. This allows handling of large models with &gt; 1000 continuous-time states.
</li>
<li>
An FMU can optionally provide analytic directional derivatives with respect to continuous-time states and to inputs. This allows a more robust and efficient simulation of systems where these partial derivatives are needed, for example for stiff solvers.
</li>
<li>
A cleaner mathematical model of an FMU both for Model Exchange and for Co-Simulation was defined.
For Model Exchange this means that "super-dense" time was introduced to describe the event 
iteration more precisely, and that algebraic loops over FMUs are supported in initialization, event, and continuous-time mode (in FMI 1.0, it was not possible to have algebraic loops in initialization or event mode).
</li></ul>
<p>
The FMI 2.0 specification, as well as supporting C-header and xml schema files can be found on the FMI <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org/downloads">Downloads page</a></p>

<p>
On the <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org/downloads">Downloads page</a> of the FMI web site, the following free services around FMI 2.0 are now available:</p>
<ul>
<li>An FMI 2.0 compliance checker to check whether an FMU is built according to the FMI 2.0 standard.</li>
<li>
An FMITest Modelica library with more than 30 difficult test cases of connected FMUs
(for example connecting two FMUs in such a way that Boolean input and output variables form a loop, but the dependency information makes it possible to find a sequential evaluation sequence of the
FMU calls).
</li>
<li> The FMU Software Development Kit (FMU SDK) of QTronic supporting FMI 2.0. It can serve as a starting point for developing applications that export or import FMUs.</li>
<li> The FMI Library of Modelon supporting FMI 2.0. It supports the import of FMUs in applications. The FMI Library is for example used in the FMI Compliance Checker.
</li>
<li>
In the near future, test FMUs from different tool vendors will be provided for different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac). The goal is that whenever a tool with FMI 2.0 support is released, corresponding test FMUs from this tool are provided publicly. This allows other tool vendors to easily test the import of these FMUs. Test FMUs from Dymola, FMUSDK, JModelica.org, MapleSim, OpenModelica and SimulationX are already available on the internal FMI svn (see screenshot at the right side) and will be made available publicly, once the corresponding tool with FMI 2.0 support is released.

<h2><a name="item303">FMI Cross-Check Rules Revised</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/FMI-Cross-Check-Rules.png" alt="FMI Cross-Check Rules Revised" />
<p>
On the <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/tools">Tools Page</a> of the FMI web site
tools are listed that support FMI. A color coding is used to indicate whether a tool
has been tested to import FMUs of other tools or to export FMUs.  The color coding further indicates whether these FMUs have been successfully imported by other tools. The rules for this table have been revised.</p>
<p>
With the release of FMI 2.0, more tool vendors have joined the Cross-Check initiative.
A number of improvement suggestions were made -- especially during the <a href="../2014-2/index_html.html#item283">FMI Plug-Fest in May 2014</a> -- regarding how to better communicate the Cross-Check results
and how to ease cross checking by tightening the rules for what to submit to the repository.</p>
<p>
The most important changes to the Cross-Check Rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearer rules for what to submit with FMUs and the Results to ease scripted cross checking,</li>
<li>stricter rules on how to attain the "green" Available tag (see screenshot to the right)
to encourage more meaningful tests and</li>
<li>added provisions for FMUs with c-code only and FMUs with runtime license checks.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
End of July 2014, the FMI Steering Committee approved V3 of the Cross-Check Rules.
This new set of rules has been applied to the Cross-Check infrastructure's non-public part.
At the end of 2014, the Cross-Check Results will be published according to the new rules.
Vendors are encouraged to update their results with the most recent, released versions of their products.</p>

<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
The new Modelica Association Project <em>System Structure and Parameterization of components for virtual system design</em> (SSP) was established on June 17, 2014. This project was initiated by Bosch, BMW and ZF. In many applications there is a need to design, simulate and execute a network of components (simulation models, software, hardware etc.). In order to make this process seamless and tool independent, the SSP project was initiated.  The purposes of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters to these components.</li>
<li>
Define a standardized format for the connection structure for a network of components.</li>
<li>
The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of the development process (architecture definition, integration, simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).
</li></ul>
<p>
It is planned to coordinate this work with other standards and organizations (FMI, ASAM, OMG).

<p>
At the recent North America Modelica Users' Group Conference in Atlanta, Xogeny presented a web-based Modelica tutorial that demonstrates some of our web-based engineering analysis technologies.  It provided a basic introduction to Modelica with a focus on representing behavior at the equation level.  Because we received a lot of positive feedback about the tutorial, we've decided to make the Modelica community at large aware of it.</p>
<p>
The tutorial can be found on the <a href="http://tour.xogeny.com/" target="_blank">Tour of Modelica</a> website, hosted by <a href="http://www.xogeny.com">Xogeny</a>.  This web-based approach does not cover the entire Modelica language and should be viewed as a complement to the freely available <a href="http://book.xogeny.com">Modelica by Example</a> book also hosted by Xogeny.</p>
<p>Our goal, with both projects, is to make Modelica more accessible to new developers.  With this new web-based approach, learning Modelica is easier than ever and with an even greater degree of interactivity than we achieved with <a href="http://book.xogeny.com" target="_blank">Modelica by Example</a>.  Through the use of responsive design, this application runs on both desktops and a variety of mobile devices as well.</p>

<h2><a name="item332">Heat Transfer Library</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/MPETHX3D.png" alt="Heat Transfer Library" />
<p>The steady-state heat exchangers from the Heat Transfer Library make efficient simulation possible for a wide variety of industries, including automotive, power plant, renewable energy, food and drink, oil and gas, and industrial cooling. The heat exchangers model the thermal connection between circuits of different fluids, even fluids from different libraries, such as Hydraulics, Pneumatics and Thermal Fluids. This enables a multi-physics analysis of the system to be studied.</p>
<p>The library comes with five different types of ready-to-use heat exchangers using the NTU-method: Fin-And-Tube, Double-Pipe, Plate, Microchannel and Shell-And-Tube. These elements are intended for fast calculation and are well suited for real-time simulation. Parameterization of the elements is geometry-based and easily be done using a data sheet from the heat exchanger manufacturer. The heat exchanger geometry can be viewed in the SimulationX 3D-view, making it easy to check for parameterization errors.</p>
<p>For fluids undergoing phase change, the heat exchange area is broken down into three regions (liquid, two-phase and gas), with each region having its own heat transfer coefficient.  Additional features of the heat exchangers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility to all SimulationX fluid libraries</li><li>Customizable geometry, material and flow arrangements</li><li>Heat transfer coefficient can be set or calculated depending on geometry and flow conditions</li><li>Valid in one-phase and two-phase regions</li><li>Constant or time varying definition of fouling factors</li><li>Contain a variety of physics-based pressure drop and heat transfer correlations</li><li>Possible to define custom heat transfer or pressure loss correlations</li></ul>
<p>
Learn more about the Steady-State Heat Exchangers and the Heat Transfer library in SimulationX in the accompanying <a href="http://www.iti.de/fileadmin/EN/ressources/library_sheets/Lib_Heat_Transfer.pdf">datasheet</a>. There is also a new video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTQSeoSO5gQ">available</a> to demonstrate how to create a model connecting fluid circuits from different libraries using a heat exchanger in SimulationX.</p>

<p>
As part of its IEA EBC Annex 60 participation, the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate, E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University released “AixLib”, a Modelica model-library with over 400 items that focuses on building performance simulations. Following the Annex 60 approach, it will be based on common base classes and extend the currently developed Annex 60-library. AixLib is being developed for research and teaching purposes and follows an open-source approach. In this way, it is ready-to-use and supports a native way of getting used to building performance simulation in Modelica. It aims at dynamic simulations of thermal and hydraulic systems to develop control strategies for HVAC systems and analyse interactions in complex systems. AixLib encompasses basic components, models for HVAC systems, models for building physics on different levels of detail and exemplary data sets for all models. It can be applied on component, building and city district level. It is freely available under Modelica License 2 and can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib">https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib</a>. The library has been developed in the simulation environment Dymola, further developments include support of OpenModelica. We welcome you to take part in this development and to raise issues using github.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/vehicle-dynamics-library/"> Vehicle Dynamics Library</a> is a model library for modeling and simulation of vehicle dynamics, including chassis and powertrain. A new release of the Vehicle Dynamics Library, 2.0, is now available from Modelon containing lots of improvements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for the Pacejka '94 'Magic Formula' contact force model has been added. The Pacejka '94 contact force model provides the benefit that it requires fewer coefficients than newer models; is more commonly used than the Pacejka '02 model; and is used in many other vehicle dynamics software products. By supporting this contact force model natively in VDL, the Pacejka '94 tire coefficients can be shared between VDL and other simulation tools.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A new live tire suspension test rig has been added that allows the application of external forces and torques at either the contact patch or wheel center/hub. It is the intent of this new rig to be able to better mimic the actual physical tests.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ground Proximity Sensors added, ground proximity information is commonly required in vehicle dynamics simulations. E.g. for contact calculations for wheels or ride heights for aerodynamics calculations and ground impacts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ride Height Dependent Aerodynamics Models. Four new aerodynamics models have been added that are dependent on front/rear ride heights. The different models demonstrate how to represent lift/drag/side aerodynamic forces.</p>

<h2><a name="item326">Virtual software validation: ETAS Virtual ECU (EVE) complies with FMI standard</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/Bild_04112014.png" alt="Virtual software validation: ETAS Virtual ECU (EVE) complies with FMI standard" />
<p>
The ETAS Virtual ECU (EVE) is a PC-based platform for virtual software development and validation. Unlike previous virtual solutions, the ECU production software is used under realistic conditions in conjunction with RTA-OS. This enables validation of application software, basic software – or even the complete ECU software – to take place within a virtual environment. Testing can be conducted in realtime as well as non-realtime modes and supports a wide range of different applications that offer a high degree of consistency across the various stages of development.</p>
<p>
Starting with v2.1, EVE complies with the FMI standard 1.0 and can be used together with any FMI based integration platform. Software validation use cases in a closed-loop setup can now be addressed early within the development process and independent of the availability of hardware prototypes – leading to increased development efficiency due to reduced development costs as well as improved software quality.</p>
<p>
Thanks to the Functional Mock-up Interface standard, domain specific modeling tools can be used for the design of individual control and plant model(s) which also facilitates the reuse of existing artifacts within the development of ECUs.</p>
<p>
The FMI support of EVE allows for early ECU software validation in a closed-loop setup on a PC and thus further extends the <a href="http://www.etas.com/en/products/applications_virtualization.php">ETAS virtualization portfolio</a>. Together with its expertise in Hardware-in-the-Loop testing (<a href="http://www.etas.com/en/products/solutions_labcar_component_overview.php">ETAS LABCAR</a>) and virtual calibration (e.g. <a href="http://www.etas.com/en/products/ascmo.php">ETAS ASCMO</a>), ETAS enables OEMs and suppliers to continuously frontload test, validation and calibration activities.</p>

       <img class="image-right" src="images/modelica-newsletter.png" alt="RegressionTest Tool for Dymola" />
<p>The <a href="http://www.claytex.com/products/regressiontest-tool-for-dymola/">RegressionTest Tool for Dymola</a> has been developed for library developers to help them improve the quality of library releases. It provides automated routines for checking models, generating reference results and running regression tests. It is a standalone application that controls Dymola and calls functions from within a supplied Modelica library.</p>
<p>The tool can be run interactively using the Graphical User Interface shown or it can be run from the command line. Using the command line option enables tests to be scheduled to run nightly in a fully automated manner. Each test that is run by the tool generates an XML report that can be loaded in to the GUI for analysis.</p>
<p>The test results are presented in a hierarchical view that recreates the library structure with different icons used to highlight whether a model is correct, generates warnings or fails the test. When there are warnings or models fail the tests within a package these are propagated up through the library structure so that they can be quickly identified and located within the library.</p>
<p>Claytex developed this tool to support the development of our Modelica libraries and it is used to automate the regression testing of all our commercial Modelica libraries and customer projects.</p>

<h2><a name="item301">Equation-Based Modelica Model Debugger</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/Debugger-pict-400x245.png" alt="Equation-Based Modelica Model Debugger" />
<p>
The OpenModelica equation-based model run-time debugger, which is part of the OpenModelica 1.9.1 

release,
(<a href="http://www.openmodelica.org">www.openmodelica.org </a>)  helps the modeler
finding the parts of the high-level equation-based model that cause problems in the
low-level generated C-code that is used for the executing simulation. Without this debugging
support it can be quite difficult to find the actual causes of errors in large models.
This is the first debugging tool that allows debugging of Modelica equation-based models
including tracing faults to individual equations.</p>
<p>
The debugger/compiler traces all symbolic
transformations done on the equation-based model on the way the executable code. This
tracing is very efficient, with less than 1% overhead. Thus, the debugger can handle large
models without noticable overhead.</p>
<p>
This debugger for equation-based models is integrated with the graphical modeling graphical
user interface OMEdit.
There is also a debugger for algorithmic model debugging (functions and algorithms) with functionality 

such
as setting breakpoints, single stepping, viewing variables etc., which is now available also in OMEdit. 

This algorithm debugger is integrated with the equation model debugger.



Some typical usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>


<li>
A numerical error occurs in the executing code, e.g., division by zero. The error occurs
in low level executable C-code that bears no resemblance to the original Modelica code.
</li>



<li>
A performance problem occurs, e.g. shattering, that is causing the solver to spend a
lot of CPU time without advancing the simulation.
</li>



<li>
The simulation runs to completion, but some values appear to be wrong. What parts of the models could 

influence these variables?
</li></ul>
<p>
In all three cases the equation model debugger allows the user to browse through the sequence of 

transformations,
all the way to the equations which cause the problems. These possibly faulty equations are pointed out 

by
the debugger.</p>

<h2><a name="item296">LMS Imagine.Lab Amesim™ Provides State-of-the-art Platform Features for Modelica Users</a></h2>

       <img class="image-right" src="images/PerformanceAnalyzer_1.png" alt="LMS Imagine.Lab Amesim™ Provides State-of-the-art Platform Features for Modelica Users" />
<p>
LMS&nbsp;Amesim from Siemens&nbsp;PLM&nbsp;Software includes a wide variety of platform features that make model development easier.  In some cases, a developer has created a Modelica model, but needs to better understand its frequency content and diagnose which parts of their model could speed up the simulation.  The performance analyzer is an LMS&nbsp;Amesim platform feature that can address these needs.  This feature generates a detailed report as the simulation proceeds, giving the user insight into the performance of the solvers on their model.</p>
<p>
With the information provided by the performance analyzer, the user can improve the CPU performance of their system.  The "Run statistics" view of the performance analyzer provides a set of metrics such as the CPU time, integration step size, and selected solver order.  The "State contributions" view displays the contribution of each state variable to the integration step size.  This knowledge can help model developers to assess whether modifying parameters or eliminating a component altogether can improve their simulation performance without altering the results more than desired.  Finally, the "Frequencies" view allows the developer to identify the eigenfrequencies of their system.</p>
<p>
Modelica developers can leverage tools like the performance analyzer and other LMS&nbsp;Amesim platform features to gain valuable insight during the model development process.  With this information, developers can improve their Modelica models and increase their productivity.</p>

<h2><a name="item306">Data-based modeling and model-based calibration with ETAS ASCMO: Now also support of FMI standard</a></h2>

       <img class="image-right" src="images/ASCMO_composition_small.png" alt="Data-based modeling and model-based calibration with ETAS ASCMO: Now also support of FMI standard" />
<p>
ETAS ASCMO enables the efficient development of accurate data-based models, allowing for advanced model-based calibration and data-based modeling. High-accuracy models are generated automatically by using modern statistical learning processes (Gaussian processes) and form the basis for significant time and cost savings within the development process. Even highly complex system behaviors can be described without the prior need for detailed system knowledge or special mathematical expertise in the used algorithm. These models can be used tool internal for optimizations or can be exported to different environments such as Matlab®/Simulink® or C-Code for being used as virtual sensors or meta-models.</p>
<p>
With v4.5 recently being launched, ETAS ASCMO now supports FMI 1.0 and 2.0 for Co-Simulation. The generated high-accuracy models can be exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) and are used to optimize parameters of real systems such as engine ECUs or plant models. Both, steady state and dynamic/transient system behaviors can be captured.</p>
<p>
One prominent use case addresses the efficient calibration of diesel- and gasoline engines. When used by Volkswagen in production calibration for example, ETAS ASCMO allowed for reduced fuel consumption by two to four per cent.</p>
<p>
The FMI support of ETAS ASCMO emphasizes once more the numerous activities of ETAS in the area of <a href="http://www.etas.com/en/products/applications_virtualization.php">virtual validation and calibration </a> based on <a href="http://www.etas.com/en/products/applications_virtualization_early_testing_validation_calibration-virtualization_standards_initiatives.php">standards</a>.

Dymola 2015 FD01 has full support for FMI 1.0 and FMI 2.0.</p>
<h4>Multi-core simulation and Favorites packages</h4>
<p>Dymola 2015 FD01 now has multi-core support to reduce simulation times by a factor of 2-3 on a standard processor for certain kinds of models. The symbolic analysis of model equations is used to partition code for parallel execution on multiple cores. No manual intervention is needed.</p>
<p>Convenient creation of Favorites packages facilitates customized models. Dragging in a 'favorite' inserts a reference to the original model. Parameter modifications can be added to represent specific components.</p>
<h4>Integration with Java, Python and JavaScript</h4>
<p>Dymola can run as a local web service, making it possible to send commands
from Java, Python and JavaScript. This allows interactive web pages to
use Dymola to run simulations, display models, set parameters and show
simulation results as plots or animations. Such an approach makes it possible for non-specialist Modelica users to  access the simulation capabilities of Dymola.</p>
<h4>Dymola 2015</h4>
<p>Dymola 2015 was released on June 6, 2014.</p>
<p>A new <strong>Flight Dynamics Library</strong> was also released that delivers powerful new modeling and simulation capabilities. Flight dynamics is a new domain for Dymola users, with the library enabling  flight load analysis, control law design, mission simulation and aircraft design analysis.</p>
<p>Dymola 2015 has full 32-bit and 64-bit support on both Windows and
Linux.</p>

<p>
With DaVE, TLK-Thermo provides a <strong>visualization and simulation environment</strong>. The data can be imported from various offline and online sources, using different file formats. A direct <strong>simulation of FMUs</strong> is also possible.</p>
<p>
DaVE contains several instruments (e.g. 2D-plot, round instruments) which can display data in various forms. The displays can be exported as common picture formats and vector graphics such as PDF files. Thus, DaVE is a very useful tool during the <strong>thermal development process and in presentations</strong>.</p>
<p>
An online visualization can be created via connection to our co-simulation environment <strong>TISC</strong> and via direct connection of measurement techniques at test-benches.</p>
<p>
Particularly for online and offline display of thermal data, DaVE is able to provide <strong>state diagrams</strong> (ph, pv, Th, Ts and hx).</p>
<p>
<strong>The latest version 1.3.0 of DaVE</strong> contains the following improvements and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create vector plots to show the temperature distribution inside a heat exchanger and other thermal plots</li>
<li>In state diagrams thermodynamic changes of state can be defined between two state points and displayed accordingly (e.g. isothermal or isobaric change of state)</li>
<li>Instruments now can be more easily configured for display of multiple variables</li>
<li>The user-friendly, time-efficient handling of large data sets with many variables has been further increased</li>
<li>Merging various data sources with different time intervals to data tables with uniform time intervals</li></ul>

<h2><a name="item334">Latest MapleSim release offers new tools for design exploration</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img class="image-right" src="images/MapleSim7CoreImage_modelica.png" alt="Latest MapleSim release offers new tools for design exploration" />
<p>Maplesoft™ has announced a new release of MapleSim™, the advanced system-level modeling and simulation platform. This release makes it substantially easier to explore and validate designs, create and manage libraries of custom components, and use MapleSim models within the engineering toolchain.</p>
<p>MapleSim offers a modern approach to physical modeling and simulation, dramatically reducing model development and analysis time while producing fast, high-fidelity simulations. In MapleSim 7, a new results manager provides greater flexibility when investigating simulation results and exploring designs. It is now possible to compare multiple simulation runs at the click of a button, including simulations of a single model and simulations of different models. Engineers can instantly plot the behavior of any variable, including variables that were not explicitly probed during the simulation. Other tools available through the results manager include the ability to easily visualize the correspondence between the 2-D plot results and the 3-D visualization of the model during simulation.</p>
<p>To support model creation, MapleSim 7 also makes it significantly easier to create, manage, and share libraries of custom components. As well, MapleSim 7 also expands the support of the Modelica language so that more Modelica definitions can be used directly inside MapleSim.</p>
<p>The MapleSim Connector for FMI, which allows engineers to share very efficient, high-fidelity models created in MapleSim with other modeling tools, has also been updated with this release.  FMI (Functional Mockup Interface) is an industry standard for defining models to facilitate the sharing of models across different tool sets. For MapleSim 7, the MapleSim Connector for FMI supports more export options for co-simulation and model exchange.</p>
<p>As part of the MapleSim 7 family of products, Maplesoft has also released a new component library. The MapleSim Battery Library, which is available as a separate add-on, allows engineers to incorporate physics-based predictive models of battery cells into their multidomain models so they can take battery behavior into account early in the design process.</p>
