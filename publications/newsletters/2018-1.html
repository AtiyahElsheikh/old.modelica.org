<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica and FMI interested,</p>

<p>the Modelica Association (MA) is restarting its newsletter.
We are happy that <a href="mailto:filip.jezek@creativeconnections.cz">Filip Ježek</a> - one of the organizers of the Modelica’2017 conference in Prague -
will be the editor and organizer of the newsletters. The plan is to have three releases per year. Furthermore, the technical infrastructure for the newsletter has changed: 
Since Modelica Association is migrating to “Software-as-a-Service” platforms to minimize our maintenance burden,  the legacy Modelica Association Newsletter application is replaced by a new GitHub based publishing process.</p>

<p>The Modelica Association board was newly elected on March 21, for the coming two years period.
The <a href="https://www.modelica.org/association">new board</a> is identical to the previous board with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hilding Elmqvist, one of the founders of the Modelica Association,
did not longer apply for the <em>Technology</em> board position. In an email to the 
Modelica Association members Hilding wrote: <em>I have been on the board in different positions from the start and I now think it’s time for younger members to push forward</em>.  <br />
Torsten Blochwitz from ESI-ITI was elected for the board position for <em>Technology.</em> The goal of this position is in particular to improve the coordination of the different standardization activities of MA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thomas Beutlich from ESI-ITI was elected as leader for the MA Project <em>Libraries</em>. 
As a deputy for this project, Dietmar Winkler from University College of Southeast Norway was elected.
Note, this MA Project recently improved its <a href="https://github.com/modelica/MAP-LIB_ProjectRules">project rules</a>
in order that the development of the Modelica Standard Library is improved.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In October last year, MA had a one-day Modelica Association Strategy Meeting to discuss the future of MA. Several of the ideas and suggestions developed at this workshop are on the way to be implemented to improve the operation of MA. To mention a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In April, MA will start its Back Office operated by <a href="http://www.ltx.de/english.html">LTX</a>.
The MA board can then delegate administrative tasks to its back office to offload work
and to improve the administrative processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The MA board and interested MA projects get more budget freedom.
In particular, the MA Project FMI will now have its own budget for the coming year,
 e.g., to organize the further development of the FMI compliance checker or
 the FMI cross check in a more effective way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The MA newsletter is reactivated with a new newsletter editor and a new technical infrastructure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FMI cross check results are currently moved to a modern infrastructure
designed and implemented by Michael Tiller, see <a href="2018-1.html#updated-fmi-cross-check-process">article below</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to enlarge the Modelica and FMI community, MA has changed its strategy regarding
Modelica conferences. Previously, the International Modelica Conference took place every 18 months in Europe.
This is changed now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The International Modelica Conference will take place every 2 years in March in Europe.
The next one will take place in <strong>March 4-6, 2019</strong> in Regensburg Germany.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the year between International Modelica Conferences,
Modelica Conferences shall be organized on other continents with country specific focus.
In 2018, the following conferences of this kind will take place:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018japan">second Japanese Modelica Conference</a>
will take place <strong>May 17-19, 2018</strong> in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2018Americas">first American Modelica Conference</a>
will take place <strong>Oct. 8-10, 2018</strong> in Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to organize a Modelica Conference, please inspect the Modelica Conference series
<a href="https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference">web page</a>.</p>

<p>If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI community, please follow the

<h2 id="updated-fmi-cross-check-process">Updated FMI Cross Check Process</h2>
<p>The FMI project collects and publishes so-called “cross check” data.  As part of this process, each vendor
publishes data about their FMI compliant tools along with FMUs exported from those tools.  This allows other
vendors to test those FMUs by importing them.  In this way, the FMI vendors work together to detect and
address any non-compliant implementations to improve the overall quality of FMI support.</p>

<p>This process used to involve one very large SVN repository where <em>all</em> vendors published not only their
tool data and FMUs but the results of their attempts to import other vendor’s FMUs.  Needless to say, with all
the large binary files and data files associated with this compliance checking process, the repository
got to be very large.  Furthermore, the Modelica Association had to manage users, permissions, disk
space, <em>etc.</em> for this effort.</p>

<p>In an attempt to streamline the process, it was decided to give every vendor their own repository.  In
these repositories, vendors compile data about themselves, their tools, sample FMUs and results of 
importing FMUs from other tools.  In this way, each vendor repository is a more manageable size and since
each vendor is managing the repository themselves, the Modelica Association doesn’t need to get involved
in the management of users, permissions, <em>etc.</em>.</p>

<p>To facilitate this process, the Modelica Association established the <a href="https://github.com/fmi-crosscheck"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fmi-crosscheck</code> organization</a>
on GitHub.  Each vendors existing FMI data was broken out into
individual vendor-specific repositories under this umbrella organization.  Furthermore, these repositories
use a technology called <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">webhooks</a> to signal when they have
been updated.  <strong>Using these webhooks, the entire process of generating the FMI web site has been automated</strong>.
Now, when any vendor pushes changes to their repository, a complete rebuild of the FMI web site is
triggered using the very latest vendor data.  As a result, the data shown on the FMI web site is always
the very latest compliance data.</p>

<p>But there were changes beyond simply creating vendor specific repositories.  The scripts that process
the data were completely rewritten.  While the previous pages on the FMI web site were static
HTML pages generated while processing the cross check data, the new process involves compiling all
the cross check data into a machine readable form and then rendering it <em>dynamically</em> on the web site.
This allows visitors to the site to search and filter the FMI compliance data interactively.  Instead of
long tables and horizontal scrollbars, the new dynamic visualization encourages users to search,
filter and zoom to explore the data which generally fits on a single page.  Users can even bookmark
specific search, filter and selection settings and/or email their results to others as a single URL.</p>

<p>A preview of
the new dynamic web site can be found at <a href="https://preview.fmi-standard.org/tools/">https://preview.fmi-standard.org</a>.
If you find any issues, please report them in the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-crosscheck-tools/issues"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fmi-crosscheck-tools</code> issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>All source code associated with the new FMI cross check process can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/fmi-crosscheck-tools"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fmi-crosscheck-tools</code> repository</a>.  This includes the scripts that process the data,
the code that is used to dynamically visualize the data as well as the source code for the build server that
handles webhook notifications and pushes out new published versions of the FMI web site.  If you are interested
in improving the cross check process, we welcome contributions via pull requests for the tools in that repository.</p>

<p>Note, if you are a vendor and you have not yet taken ownership of your new repository, please <a href="mailto:michael.tiller@gmail.com">contact me</a> so you can be added as an admin to your repository.</p>

<p>With the new infrastructure working, the FMI Steering Committee will now update the FMI Cross-Check Rules and then implement those new rules in the new infrastructure during the next few months.</p>

<h2 id="pde-for-systems-call-for-use-cases">PDE for Systems: Call for Use Cases</h2>
<p>A new project proposal called <strong>PDE</strong> (partial differential equations) <strong>for Systems</strong> was initiated at the Modelica Design Meeting on March 20, 2018. It addresses the utilization of reduced order models originating from semi-discretized PDE (such as finite difference/element/volume models) from various physical domains  in system simulations in a standardized, tool-independent way. This includes the definition of non-proprietary standard formats to export data from associated tools but also aims to specify a standardized, extended Functional Mock-up Interface (xFMI) component as shown in the workflow instance below. The goal is to organize model exchange and co-simulation of reduced order PDE-models in system simulation and represent cyber-physical systems with relevant distributed properties this way.</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/WorkflowPDEForSystems.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The project is supposed to be driven by a collection of use cases which in particular demonstrate the added value of such a standardized interface component and attract industry and commercial PDE-tool vendors.  Everyone who feels appealed by the project idea is strongly requested to submit use case candidates similar to the use case <a href="https://github.com/modelica/pde-for-systems/blob/master/use-cases/healt-monitoring-of-composite.md">Health Monitoring of Composite</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/pde-for-systems/tree/master/use-cases">repository</a>, preferably by June 1, 2018.</p>

<p>The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA
from <strong>October 9 - 10, 2018</strong>. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica
Users’ Group (NAMUG).</p>

<p>Registration is already open with early bird discounts available until August 20th at
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447">Eventbrite</a></p>

<p>The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to
share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to the Modelica
modeling language and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). The program will cover modeling of complex
physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial
applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. This conference
is co-organized by the North American Modelica Users’ Group (NAMUG) and the Modelica Association.</p>

<p>This conference will feature one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as
you would find at any Modelica conference.  In addition, it will also have one track of industrial,
user-oriented presentations like those found at typical NAMUG events over the last 5 years.  These presentations
do not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts for the presentations will also
be peer-reviewed by the conference board.</p>

<h4 id="free-workshops-october-8th">Free Workshops October 8th</h4>

<p>Thanks to the generous support from MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab), NAMUG
will organize two <strong>free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th</strong> (before the conference).  These workshops
will take place at the MERL offices in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops,
please select “Workshop Ticket” on the
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447">Eventbrite</a> event page.
There will be a beginner’s workshop in the morning, and an advanced workshop with an introduction to
modeling of thermo-fluid systems using applications from the Buildings Library in the afternoon. To aid in planning,
<strong>please register soon for these workshops</strong> since these workshops are conditional on interest and participation.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.</p>

Help the user to build consistent systems from FMUs and render the systems more intuitively with better representation of structured ports (for instance buses and physical connectors) in the modelDescription.xml.</li>
  <li>Array variables:
Allow FMUs to communicate multi-dimensional variables and change their sizes using structural parameters.</li>
  <li>Clocks and Hybrid Co-Simulation
Introduces clocks for synchronization of variables changes across FMUs. Allows co-simulation with events.</li>
  <li>Binary Data Type:
Adds an opaque binary data type to FMU variables to allow, for instance, efficiently exchanging of complex sensor data.</li>
  <li>Intermediate Output Values:
Allow access of intermediate output values between communication time points from the FMU to disclose relevant subsystem behavior for analysis or advanced co-simulation master algorithms.</li>
  <li>Source code FMUs:
Adding more information to the modelDescription.xml file to improve automatic import of source code FMUs.</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect to conclude the now following prototype-phase mid 2018 with a potentially shortened Beta feature list of proven FMI 2.1 features.
In the unlikely event of unsolvable conflicts between features, the FMI Steering Committee might be forced to again remove or alter
features during the merge-phase of all FMI Change Proposals (FCPs) starting after the release of the Beta feature list.
The FMI Steering Committee will make these FCPs available to interested parties on request once their maturity allows dissemination.</p>

<h2 id="first-release-of-fluiddynamics-library-for-cfd-simulations-in-modelica">First Release of FluidDynamics Library for CFD Simulations in Modelica</h2>
<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/xrg-fluiddynamics-library.jpg" alt="FluidDynamics logo" title="FluidDynamics logo" width="620px" /></p>

<p>The <strong>FluidDynamics</strong> library is created for <strong>Computational Fluid Dynamics</strong> (CFD) simulations using Modelica language. The coarse grid model of the library allowing up to 2000 cells uses common CFD equations, but the model is written entirely in Modelica language.
The flow is predicted purely by the outer boundary conditons, internal stresses and gravitation. Thus, it has the great advantage, that users must not know the flow pattern in an air-conditoned space.</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/transient_room.gif" alt="Transient room" title="Passive office heat-up" width="440px" /></p>

<h4 id="user-benefits">User Benefits</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Faster execution time</strong> than conventional CFD</li>
  <li><strong>Less software costs</strong> since no middleware between CFD and Modelica tool required</li>
  <li><strong>Faster project execution</strong> since conceptual tasks can be performed with the coarse grid</li>
  <li><strong>Full insight</strong> into code through open-source Modelica implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>The library is available for <strong>Dymola 2018 FD01</strong>. Grid generation and postprocessing is performed with <strong>XRG Score</strong> included in the package. It can be used for automotive, aeronautical, buildings and other HVAC applications.</p>

</div>

<p>The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations. The current <strong>version 3.5.0</strong> includes numerous new and improved components and system models. Among other things, we would like to draw your attention to the following innovations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the gas components, air pathways and systems can be simulated with ideal gases and mixtures, taking <strong>condensation and ice formation</strong> into account.</li>
  <li>The optimization of the VLE fluid components (vapor-liquid-equilibrium) enables more robust simulations of <strong>refrigerant circuits, heat pumps</strong> or other systems with working fluids.</li>
  <li>With the aid of new and optimized liquid components (hydraulic inductor and compensation tanks), <strong>cooling circuits</strong> and <strong>hydraulic systems</strong> can be calculated much faster and more stable.</li>
  <li>Completely revised and clearly extended documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-library-1-0-create-and-run-regression-tests">Testing Library 1.0 - Create and run regression tests</h2>
<p>The Testing Library is a Modelica Library available to all Dymola users. 
With this library it is possible to build test cases, create reference results and run the tests –
all within Dymola. It allows detecting unwanted side effects on model changes in an early
stage by running regular tests. The user can also use the library to validate that a system meets its requirement during the development phase.</p>

<p>The library contains multiple blocks for the continuous
comparison of signals to reference values and trajectories. Existing examples and test
models can easily be converted to a test case by providing a reference and connecting the
signals of interest to one of the various comparison blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/TestingLibrary_LossyGearDemo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Test models can be simulated as any other model. At the end of the simulation the
message window shows the test result for every check block in the model.
This allows the developer to check regularly during the development if the tests class behaves as expected.</p>

<h2 id="pneumatic-systems-library">Pneumatic Systems Library</h2>
<p>The new Pneumatic Systems Library (PSL) is intended to assist the development of pneumatic systems. PSL enables predicting the system behavior for a wide range of industrial applications such as industrial machines, pneumatic brakes or suspension systems
as well as cooling and engine bleed air systems for aerospace.</p>

<p>In this first release, the following components are introduced:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gases: IdealAir model and ImportFromMSL so any media model extending from Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium can be used for gas properties.</li>
  <li>Sources: ideal pressure, mass flow rate and exhaust, silencer and a vane compressor.</li>
  <li>Valves: directional, proportional and flow control valves.</li>
  <li>Actuators: linear, rotary and bellow drive.</li>
  <li>Reservoirs.</li>
  <li>Piping: tube, bend and a custom pressure loss component.</li>
  <li>Sensors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The library also includes a package modeling the main physical effects modeled: capacitance (energy storage), resistance (energy dissipation) and power transformation (mechanical and thermal). These effects serve as a basis for the development of the previously listed components.</p>

<p>The component icons are compliant with the standard ISO 1219 which is typically used for pneumatic schematics. Animation is provided to see the valve and cylinder displacement with respect to their command.</p>

<p>As an example, the following model represents two single-acting cylinders with spring feedback, piloted by a single directional control valve alternatively connecting to an ideal pressure source or exhaust. While the top cylinder does not include any cushioning device, the piston of the bottom cylinder will close the inlet port when it approaches its end stop (throttle effect).</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/PneumaticSystemsLibrary-cushioning-model.png" alt="" title="Pneumatic Systems Example" /></p>

<p>This example covers the main physical effects involved into pneumatics: capacitance as the gas volume inside the cylinder, restriction as the inlet flow restriction into the cylinder and transformation as the cylinder converts pneumatic into mechanic power.</p>

<p>As the example uses a one-sided cylinder, cushioning only happens on the left side of the cylinder actuation. When the piston enters the cushioning zone (below the green line), the cylinder with cushioning (red plot) receives less mass flow rate from the inlet port and thus its speed decreases regarding the top cylinder (blue plot).</p>

<h2 id="modelica-arduino-a-virtual-arduino-uno-and-firmata-for-modelica">Modelica Arduino - a virtual Arduino Uno and Firmata for Modelica</h2>
<p>With the Arduino Modelica library you can simulate your circuits and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sketch">sketches</a> on a virtual <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> and connect your Modelica models to real-world circuits using the <a href="http://www.firmata.org/">Firmata protocol</a>.</p>

<p>It’s developed by Dassault Systèmes and released under the GPLv3 on <a href="https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/Modelica-Arduino">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4>

<p>The ArduinoUno model is driven by an ExternalObject that contains the compiled sketch and an implementation of the Arduino API. The external object is synchronized at every sample step with the Modelica model.</p>

<p>When a model that contains the ArduinoUno block is translated the external object is automatically re-built through the preInstantiate=Arduino.Internal.buildSketch(…) directive in its annotation.</p>

<p>This function writes a new Sketch.cpp to Arduino/Resources/Source/Arduino that includes the sketch currently selected in the ArduinoUno component and calls the build script build_sketch.bat.</p>

<p>This script re-builds the shared libraries Arduino/Resources/Library/win32/ModelicaArduino.dll and win64/ModelicaArduino.dll that contain the implementation of the external object.</p>

<h2 id="hydrogen-library-1-0-pem-fuel-cell-systems">Hydrogen Library 1.0 - PEM Fuel cell systems</h2>
<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/Hydrogen-image.png" alt="" width="70%" /></p>

<p>The Hydrogen library is targeted at modeling and simulating of PEM fuel cell stacks and
fuel cell systems using hydrogen and air. It may be used for pre-design, control strategy
evaluation, or loss analysis. The library contains models for membranes and complete stacks
as well as auxiliary components, e.g. compressors and valves.
Due to the generic equivalent circuit approach, only the data sheet with a polarization curve
is needed for the parameterization of the membrane models. A tutorial helps the user to
adapt the stack templates to his/her fuel cell type.</p>

<h2 id="electric-power-systems-library">Electric Power Systems Library</h2>
<p>The Electric Power Systems Library (EPSL) is intended to assist the process of designing electrical power systems. It enables modeling Alternate Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) as well as combined AC/DC (hybrid) networks found e.g. in More Electrical Aircrafts. Due to the use of a phasor based description, it enables fast simulation of AC systems, with performance basically independent of the AC system’s frequency. The EPSL covers the key components of an electrical power system at different levels of detail. The architectural mode corresponds to “simple” phasor theory resulting in a quasi-static description of the system. The functional level of detail uses dynamic phasors to cover dynamic effects in the models. The modeling mode can currently be switched on a per-component basis via a parameter.
Additionally, the EPSL enables the description of harmonics of the fundamental AC frequency, which can be either constant or variable. Currently the AC components are either single or three-phased, whereas other phase numbers would be straight-forward to be added due to the generic modeling approach of components.
As an example, part of a generic aircraft electric power system architecture, proposed and studied within the MOET european project [MOET06], is modeled using EPSL in Dymola.
The power generation is realized thanks to the aircraft engines connected directly to Variable Frequency Starter Generators. The VFSGs convert the mechanical power into electrical power. The electrical power is then distributed to the consumers through High Voltage AC bus bar and DC bus bars.
Typical loads on the system are, for example: Environmental Control System (ECS), Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMA), Wing Icing Protection System.</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-01/EPSL-MOET.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>This architecture considers a large aircraft with four engines. The circuit associated to the first generator is illustrated in the figure above.</p>
