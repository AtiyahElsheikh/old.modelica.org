<h2><a name="letter">Letter from the Board</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
Dear Modelica Interested,</p>
<p>
in this second newsletter, the most important information from the Modelica 
Association and the Modelica community is summarized for the exciting
first half year in 2009:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li> After 20 months of development the new <strong>version 3.1</strong> of the Modelica language
     has been released at end of May 2009, 
     <a href="index_html.html#mod31">see below</a>.
     New language elements have been verified by prototype implementations
     (mostly in Dymola) and by their usage in new, free Modelica libraries
     that are under development.</li>

<li> After 18 months, a new <strong>Modelica Conference</strong> will take place at Lake Como in northern Italy
     (<a href="index_html.html#conference">see below</a>).
     There will be about 25% more papers as on the last Modelica conference and also the tool presentations
     in the tool session increases to eight Modelica tools.
     This is accomplished due to the increased number of submitted papers and
     by moving the Modelica tutorials to Sunday (previously they have
     been on Monday morning).</li>

<li> Directly after the Modelica Conference, the one day workshop on
     "<strong>Equation Based Object-Oriented Languages and Tools</strong>", EOOLT'2009, 
     takes place at the same location as the Modelica Conference 
     (<a href="index_html.html#eeolt">see below</a>).  
     This workshop is dedicated for computer scientists working on equation based languages.
     The co-location of Modelica Conference and EOOLT workshop is only performed this time.
     In the future, the EOOLT workshop is planned to be between two Modelica Conferences, as it 
     was done in the past.</li>

<li> In April, the "<strong>Modelica for Education</strong>" Workshop took place in Berlin. As an
     outcome of this workshop, the Modelica Association is organizing 
     open source <strong>teaching material</strong> for Modelica courses
     (<a href="index_html.html#educationalworkshop">see below</a>).</li>

<li> In this newsletter a new section is started about "<strong>Modelica Libraries</strong>" provided
     by the Modelica community:
<ul>
     <li> <strong>FlexBody</strong>, a new library for flexible bodies to import finite element
          models from Nastran and Genesis, was developed
          and is distributed by Claytex
          (<a href="index_html.html#claytex">see below</a>).</li>
     <li> The <strong>VehicleDynamics</strong> library from Modelon is
          considerably enhanced for <strong>active safety</strong> components and 
          for <strong>hybrid vehicles</strong>
          (<a href="index_html.html#modelon2">see below</a>).</li>
     <li> BAUSCH-GALL GmbH (the former Dymola distributor in Germany)
          offers marketing and distribution of commercial
          Modelica libraries for all Modelica tools,
          <a href="index_html.html#bauschgall">see below</a>.
          This might be especially interesting for Universities, research organizations 
          and small companies that want to sell their modeling know-how in form of Modelica libraries
          with a minimum amount of administrative and legal effort. 
          BAUSCH-GALL starts with three libraries
          (<strong>Belts</strong>, <strong>FlexibleBodies</strong>, <strong>HumanComfort</strong>), and plans to considerably 
          enlarge this library portfolio in the next years.</li></ul>
If you have interesting news for your free or commercial Modelica libraries,
     please consider to sent in an article for one of the next newsletters.
     </li>

<li> Since end of June, Modelica is available in <strong>CATIA Systems</strong> (V6R2010), 
     <a href="index_html.html#catia">see below</a>.
     This is a big step since for the first time simulation of the dynamic behavior
     of multi-domain systems is fully integrated in to the product life cycle management system of a 
     world leader in this area. This will give completely new opportunities for industry.
     </li>

<li> The new british company deltatheta offers a <strong>Modelica Software Development Kit</strong>,
     i.e., an application programming interface to operate on Modelica models and libraries
     (<a href="index_html.html#modsdk">see below</a>).
     This will offer new possibilities for the integration of Modelica in
     other environments.</li>

<li> The new version <strong>Dymola 7.2</strong> provides support for the new streams concept introduced
     in Modelica 3.1 and therefore supports also the free Modelica_Fluid
     library to reliably model fluid systems in Modelica 
     (<a href="index_html.html#dymola">see below</a>)</li>

<li> <strong>SimlationX 3.2</strong> is the second Modelica tool that supports the whole Modelica
     language (3.0) and in particular the <strong>MultiBody</strong> sublibrary from the
     Modelica Standard Library. Also the new streams concept from Modelica 3.1
     is supported, and therefore the free Modelica_Fluid library
     can be utilized
     (<a href="index_html.html#iti">see below</a>).
     These are very good news for the Modelica community since
     tool alternatives make the Modelica market even more interesting
     for organizations that do not want to lock their models to one vendor.
     </li>

<li> The <strong>Modelon</strong> company is expanding from Sweden to <strong>Germany</strong>,
     <a href="index_html.html#modelon1">see below</a>.
     These are very good
     news for the Dymola users in Germany, because Modelon is now a Dymola
     reseller in Germany
     that additionally provides engineering services with experienced
     Modelica specialists, especially in the fluid and automotive area.

<h2><a name="mod31">Modelica Specification 3.1 Released</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
The new version 3.1 of the Modelica language was released on May 27, 2009.
The specification document is available 
<a href="documents/ModelicaSpec31.pdf">here in pdf format</a>.
This release is backward compatible to the previous 3.0 release
(with tiny exceptions such as the new "stream" keyword).
The essential changes with respect to 3.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stream variables</strong><br />
The two basic variable types in a connector – "potential" (or across) variable and "flow"
(or through) variable – are not sufficient to describe in a numerically sound way
the bi-directional flow of matter, since specific quantities are determined from the 
<u>upstream</u> side of the flow, and then <u>Boolean iteration</u> variables
for the flow direction are present
in equation systems. This fundamental problem is addressed in Modelica 3.1 by introducing a 
third type of connector variable, called <u>stream variable</u>, declared with the prefix 
<strong>stream</strong>. A detailed derivation and explanation is given in Appendix D
of the Modelica 3.1 specification document and 
<a href="education/educational-material/lecture-material/english/ModelicaStream-Overview-Rationale.ppt">here</a>
(PowerPoint slides). A new Modelica library with stream
variables is available as <a href="#">Modelica_Fluid</a>. This library
will be included in the next version 3.1 of the Modelica Standard Library.
</li>

<li><strong>Mapping of Models to Execution Environments</strong><br />
New language elements are introduced to define the partitioning of models in 
parts and mapping these parts to <u>tasks</u> and <u>sub-tasks</u> on <u>target</u> machines.
This allows a convenient definition of, e.g., Model-in-the-Loop, Software-in-the-Loop,
Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation, or production code for a target machine, from
the same <u>logical</u> system architecture, by inheriting
from the model that represents the logical system architecture
and by setting configuration options. To support this concept,
a free library Modelica_EmbeddedSystems is currently under development to provide
a convenient user interface to the newly introduced (low level) language elements.
One fundamental difference to other approaches in the embedded systems area is that
the model partitioning is not defined by a block hierarchy,
but by just marking the boundaries of the parts. This allows a more flexible and more
convenient definition. It is planned to extend this concept
in future releases.</li>

<li><strong>Operator overloading</strong><br />
Overloading of operators like "+" or "*" is defined to allow convenient
usage of user-defined data structures like
complex numbers, polynomials, or transfer functions. 
One fundamental difference to operator overloading in other
languages is that only scalar operations for one data type need to be
overloaded. All other needed operations, like operations between different
data types or on <u>arrays</u> of the new data type, can be <u>automatically</u>
constructed by the Modelica tool. Therefore, the typical "explosion" of the number of
overloaded functions does not occur here.
This is a first step and more 
features might be introduced later, based on the gained experience. To allow 
future refinements while minimizing the risk that semantics of existing models 
are changed, the design is conservative and restrictive. This is reached by 
basing the overloading on disjoint sets of matching functions and not on a 
priority match as it is often done in other languages.
</li>

<li><strong>Improved buses</strong><br />
The usage of expandable connectors (which are usually used to model signal buses)
is considerably improved: (a) There is much better support for arrays. (b)
All potential bus variables can be included in the bus. The semantics is that 
only bus variables that are referenced in a model are utilized during
code generation.</li>

<li><strong>Improved resource handling</strong><br />
Modelica specific URIs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI">Uniform Resource Identifier</a>) 
can be used for links in html-documentation and for the Bitmap
annotation. Example: The file name of an image might be 
given as "Modelica://Modelica.Mechanics/Images/body.png". The meaning is
that image "body.png" shall be used that is stored in the directory of
package Modelica.Mechanics under directory "Images". This allows to store
resources in a package on persistent storage, like a file or a data base system,
and to reference resources via package and resource names. It is planned that in 
a future release of Modelica, all types of resources, including maps, tables, and
object libraries, can be referenced in this way.</li>

<li><strong>Various minor improvements and fixes of defects</strong>
<ul>
<li> New annotation <u>connectorSizing</u> to
     automatically enlarge a vector of connectors and connect to a free element of
     this vector when a connection line is drawn (enhances considerably the user convenience 
     in Modelica.StateGraph and Modelica.Fluid).</li>
<li> Annotation <u>inverse</u> to define
     inverses of functions (will be used in Modelica.Media and Modelica.Fluid).</li>
<li> Annotations <u>versionDate</u>, <u>versionBuild</u>, <u>dateModified</u>, 
     <u>revisionId</u> to improve version handling.</li>
<li> The order of classes stored in separate files can be given (so loading a package from a 
     file system preserves the previously defined order of classes).</li>
<li> A restriction of balanced models with regards to modifiers on connectors and records
     was removed (this allows a much simper implementation of the support connector of the 
     Rotational and Translational libraries).</li>
<li> and more ...</li></ul>

<h2><a name="educationalworkshop">Education Workshop + Teaching Material</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
On April 2nd, 2009 the Workshop on "Modelica for Education" took place at
the Technische Universität Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>
At the  workshop seven presentations were given on the topics such as
how Modelica is currently taught, student projects with Modelica
real-time applications, and Modelica teaching requirements for industrial product development. The presentations are available for download on the
<a title="Workshop on Modelica for Education" class="generated" href="../../../events/ModelicaEducational2009/index_html.html">Workshop on Modelica for Education</a> page.</p>
<p>The closing discussion was about how teaching of Modelica can be
improved in the future and how the various institutions can share their
efforts in an easy way.</p>
<img class="image-right" src="ModelicaOverviewSlide.png" alt="" />
<p>
We thank all participants and presenters from Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,
and U.S.A. for an interesting and productive workshop.
<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As a first outcome of the discussion at the workshop, the Modelica Association 
has started a new web page 
<a href="../../../education.html">www.modelica.org/education</a>
that shall collect material to help lecturers to teach Modelica at Universities
and in industry.</p>
<p>
The page contains a list of Modelica lecturers 
together with information about their course and contact data.
Furthermore, it is planned to provide <strong>open source Modelica course and exercise material</strong>
here in various languages (such as PowerPoint slides and Modelica exercise models).
The goal is that lecturers can directly use this material in their courses.
As a start, two (English) PowerPoint slide sets are provided: (1) Slides that give an
overview about Modelica and (2) slides that introduce the new streams concept
for modeling of fluid systems together with a detailed rational for this new
approach.</p>
<p>
If you also give Modelica lectures, please consider to give lecture and contact
information on this page. You might also consider to share some of your teaching
material with the Modelica community.</p>

<h2><a name="modlic2">Modelica License 2</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>
The Modelica License 2 has been released at end of last year.
<a href="../../../licenses/ModelicaLicense2.html">It is available from here</a>
together with a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).
This license is now used for all material from the Modelica Association distributed to the public.
Especially, version 3.0.1 of the Modelica Standard Library from January 2009 was published under this license.
It is recommended that other providers of free Modelica packages license them also under this license. This license was designed with the help of lawyers from different organizations. There are the following reasons why the Modelica Association changes from Modelica License 1.1 to this new license text:</p>
<ol>
<li> The rights of licensor and licensee are more clearly defined, especially:
<ul>
     <li> A Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (Original Work), or part of it,
          can be used in <u>unmodified</u> form
          in open source and commercial software. The licensee cannot
          change the license of the Original Work and it must be provided without fees.</li>

     <li> If a model component is copied out of a Modelica package under Modelica License 2
          and is <u>modified</u> in order to adapt it to the needs of the modeler (Derivative Work),
          then the result can be licensed under any license (including a commercial license).
          The attribution notices (like author information) of the original component
          must be kept in the Derivative Work.</li>  

     <li> If a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 is modified 
          (besides error fixes, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations,
          using a subset of the package, or using a binary representation),
          then the (root-level) name of this package must be changed. </li>

     <li> If an executable is constructed from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2,
          then this executable can be licensed under any license (including a commercial
          license).</li></ul>
</li>

<li> There are several new provisions that shall make law suites against licensors and licensees
     more unlikely (so the small risk is further reduced).</li></ol>
<p>
The Modelica Association hopes that this compromise between open source contributors, commercial Modelica environments
and Modelica users will motivate even more people to provide their Modelica packages freely
under the Modelica License 2.</p>

<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<img class="image-right" src="bauschgall_libs.png/image_preview" alt="Bausch-Gall Commercial Libraries" width="20%" />
<p>BAUSCH-GALL GmbH has started with the (world-wide) distribution of commercial Modelica libraries.
Currently, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belts Library</strong> (from Frank Rettig):<br />
    This library provides models for the static and dynamic analysis
    of belt drive systems. The library was presented at the Modelica Conference 2008.
    After the conference it was improved and more features were added.
    The library is currently available for Dymola.
    It is planned to make it available for SimulationX soon.
</li>

<li>
<strong>FlexibleBodies Library</strong> (from DLR):<br />
This library provides components to model large motions of beams and of flexible
bodies exported from finite element programs.
The flexible bodies can have a large reference motion and stress stiffening terms 
are taken into account. Basically two components are provided: "Beam" to model
Rayleigh beams and "ModalBody" to model order reduced finite element models based
on the SID format (for more details see
<a href="../../../events/modelica2006/Proceedings/sessions/Session1d1.pdf">this article</a>).<br />
BAUSCH-GALL also supplies the preprocessor FEMBS from Intec that is capable to generate an SID file 
from the FE programs ABAQUS, ANSYS, Nastran, I-DEAS, and PERMAS (with special order reduction
methods, optional inclusion of stress stiffening terms and generation of animation information which
is used from the FlexibleBodies library).<br />
This library is currently available for Dymola.
</li>
<li>
<strong>HumanComfort Library</strong> (from XRG Simulation GmbH)<br />
This library provides models to estimate the human comfort within an air-conditioned zone.
It consists of four modules for weather, air conditioning system, zone, and human comfort.
The library will be offered as soon as it will be available.
Currently, we supply a demo version for Dymola.

<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<img class="image-right" src="excavator.png/image_preview" alt="FlexBody Library" width="20%" />
<p>
Claytex has recently announced the release of a new Modelica library for modelling flexible bodies called the FlexBody library.  The library reads standard output files from Finite Element Analysis tools including Nastran and Genesis and uses these to define the flexible body in Modelica.</p>
<p>
These Finite element analysis tools already include the capability to reduce large, complex, finite element models to models consisting of a small number of boundary nodes, or attachment points, and a defined number of frequency modes.  We utilise this capability and read the standard output files produced by these tools to define the flexible object within Modelica.  The FlexBody library is compatible with the standard Modelica MultiBody library.</p>
<p>
The library has been tested with Dymola 7.1 and later.  For further details please contact <a href="mailto:sales@claytex.com">sales@claytex.com</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="modelon2">VehicleDynamics with active safety and hybrid cars</a></h2>
<h2><a name="modelon2"></a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<p>Recently, The Vehicle Dynamics Library has been substantially
extended to cover active safety and driveline control applications with
two new
options:</p>
<p>
The <strong>Drivelines</strong> option is targeted to the development
of vehicle drivelines, including especially effects of shafts, joints,
gears, and clutches. The add-on contains a template structure that
allows for convenient design of different topologies, both hybrid and
conventional. The driveline models are based on Modelon's Rotational3D
library which results in a much more efficient simulation of 3D effects
compared to a standard multi-body representation. This means that
effects such as the torque ripple due to universal joints can be
captured even in complete vehicle system simulations.</p>
<p>
The <strong>Active Safety</strong> option is targeted to the
development of active safety functions and comes with extended signal
routing functionality and predefined functions for anti-lock brakes,
yaw stability, traction control, and more. Users can set up traffic
scenarios, and equip the vehicles with sensors to detect both
surrounding objects and road information. This includes sensors for
distance to closest object, relative speed of object in front, road
curvature, distance to lane border, and more. The result is a platform
for complete systems integration with efficient simulation of the
driver – environment – vehicle – safety system behavior. This is
illustrated using the brake assist example in the illustration to the right.</p>

  user data in custom annotations.</li></ul>
<p>The <strong>Modelica SDK</strong> has been designed 
to ease rapid development of Modelica based tools and has a number of 
key features to achieve this:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Classes are loaded on demand 
  and the SDK manages loaded classes in memory, loaded files and the Modelica 
  path.</li>
<li>Classes, components, equations, 
  connections and annotations can all be created, modified and deleted, 
  and a sophisticated listener mechanism is supplied for editors.</li>
<li>Queries can be executed 
  to locate classes or components matching a specified pattern, annotation 
  values can be extracted, and the flattened model can be interrogated 
  for variables and equations.</li>
<li>A flexible code generation 
  architecture is used allowing translation to any language or platform.</li></ul>
<p><strong>deltatheta</strong> is a new company 
launched with the goal of enhancing Modelica integration into the engineering 
process. <strong>deltatheta</strong> is based in Coventry, UK.</p>

<h2><a name="dymola">Dymola 7.2</a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<img class="image-right" src="VLD_truck.png" alt="VDL" width="30%" />
<p>Dymola 7.2 was released in March 2009. It contains many enhancements and extensions, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved authoring of Modelica text: In particular, the Insert Function Call command allows 
  browsing for functions and then entering the arguments, for easy insertion 
  of a function call.</li>
  <li>Dymola 7.2 provides full support for the recently developed Modelica_Fluid library version 
  1.0, including the newly introduced stream variable concept. The Modelica_Fluid 
  library contains components describing 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow 
  in a network of components and pipes.</li>
  <li>Vehicle Dynamics <strong>
  Trucks</strong> library: covers combinations such as trucks with full trailers 
  and tractors with semi-trailers. The component set is complemented with 
  models of air suspension, liquid loads, twin tires, and more. </li>
  <li>Vehicle Dynamics <strong>

  Drivelines</strong> library: makes it possible to study the interaction between 
  the driveline and the chassis on a more detailed level; including wind-up, 
  joint-bending, reaction forces and torques.</li>
  <li>Real-time simulation: 
  support for multi-tasking of DymolaBlocks in a single real-time application.</li></ul>
<p>
Dymola 7.3 with considerably enhanced authoring capabilities will be released in September before the Modelica Conference and will be demonstrated at the Dymola tool session at the conference.</p>

<h2><a name="iti">ITI launches SimulationX 3.2 in new shape and with full Modelica support</a></h2>
<h2><a name="iti"></a></h2>
<br /> &nbsp; <br />
<img class="image-right" src="simulationx-screenshot.png" alt="SimulationX screenshot" width="40%" />
<p>
In June 2009, ITI GmbH, an internationally leading company in virtual system engineering,
launched the latest version of SimulationX. From now on the version 3.2 is worldwide available
online. SimulationX 3.2 provides numerous functional enhancements, particularly with regard to
Modelica: For the last years, ITI has been actively supporting the development of the object-
oriented description language Modelica for the standard physical modeling. Users of SimulationX
3.2 now benefit from the whole range of Modelica standard libraries as they can finally access the
Modelica Multi-body systems library and the new Modelica fluid library. The pooling of parameters
to dialog pages and groups as well as the conditioned visibility of parameters can also be defined
with Modelica.</p>
<p>
Apart from this, the guideline of the permitted model variants is now clearly integrated in the user
interface. With modifications and re-declarations the development of flexible reusable models is
supported, and the comfortable graphical SimulationX user interface has been expanded.
Furthermore, new and directly applicable model elements in the libraries clutches, actuators,
drive accessories, motors, hydraulics, pneumatics, MBS mechanics (multi-body mechanics)
enrich the validated model pool for SimulationX users. Especially the field of MBS mechanics
provides an enlarged model range and numerous new characteristics to simplify the simulation of
complex technical systems and to accelerate analysis up to 25 percent.</p>
<p>
The new version of SimulationX 3.2.and results of latest development projects will be in the focus
of various ITI presentations at this year’s Modelica Conference from September, 22nd to 24th in
Como/Italy.</p>
