<h2 id="letter-from-the-board">Letter from the Board</h2>
<p>Dear Modelica and FMI interested,</p>

<p>The Modelica Association is very pleased about the successful second 
Japanese Modelica Conference, held in Japan on May 2018. The conference 
had 3 keynotes, 37 papers, 10 exhibitors and more as 140 attendees, 
about 25 % from outside of Japan, mainly from Europe and Korea.</p>

<p>As already announced in the last newsletter, <em>The International Modelica Conference</em> 
will take place now every 2 years in March in Europe. The next one will take 
place in <strong>March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg</strong> Germany (deadline for paper 
submissions: <strong>Nov. 5, 2018</strong>). We hope many of you will participate. 
More details about the conference are available 
<a href="2018-02.html#13th-international-modelica-conference-2019">below</a>.
In the year between International Modelica Conferences, Modelica Conferences shall
be organized on other continents with country specific focus.
Besides the conference in Japan, this year the first American Modelica
Conference will take place in <strong>Boston, Oct. 9-10, 2018</strong>. More details about
this conference are available <a href="2018-02.html#american-modelica-conference-2018-october-9-10">below</a>.
If you also would like to organize a Modelica Conference, please inspect the 
<a href="https://www.modelica.org/publications/ModelicaConference">Modelica Conference series</a> 
for instructions.</p>

<p>The MA Backoffice, operated by <a href="http://www.ltx.de/english.html">LTX</a> has 
started its operation in April 2018 and helps the MA board with administrative
tasks (<em>e.g.</em> to fulfill the EU GDPR regulations, organize the FMI crosscheck acounts,
create MA stickers, <em>etc.</em>). In particular, the backoffice is now also maintaining a 
<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=backoffice%40modelica.org">Google calendar</a>
(add to <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/backoffice%40modelica.org/public/basic.ics">ics supporting calendar applications</a>, such as Outlook) 
about MA activities. If you have dates that should be included
(<em>e.g.</em> Modelica or FMI web meetings, or the date of a Modelica User Group meeting),
please send an email to <a href="mailto:backoffice@modelica.org">the MA backoffice</a> with this information.</p>

<p>All MA projects are very active. As an example, a new version of the <strong>Modelica Standard Library</strong>
is on the way. At the end of June, <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/tag/v3.2.3-beta.3">Beta.3</a> 
was tagged that contains <a href="https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/releases/download/v3.2.3-beta.3/ResolvedGitHubIssues.pdf">472</a> 
resolved issues.</p>

<p>MA is on the way to move nearly all of its infrastructure to Github. In the past, the FMI web page
and svn, as well as the Modelica Standard Library svn and issue  tracker have been moved.
Recently, the move of the FMI cross check results has been finished.
In the near future, all remaining issue trackers will be moved from trac to github.</p>

<p>A new MA project will most likely start in the near future:
<strong>DCP - The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol</strong>.
This important new standardization activity will strengthen the very successful
<a href="https://fmi-standard.org/">FMI standard</a> by providing missing functionality for
distributed simulations. DCP is a standard that is being developed in the
ITEA project <a href="https://itea3.org/project/acosar.html">ACOSAR</a>.
It is planned to publish the ACOSAR results as the DCP standard via 
the Modelica Association and perform the further development as an MA project.
The MA welcomes the new project leader, Martin Krammer from <a href="https://www.v2c2.at/">V2C2</a>,
and his deputy, Klaus Schuch from <a href="https://www.avl.com">AVL</a>.</p>

<p>If you have interesting news for the Modelica and FMI communities, please follow the
<a href="submission-guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a>. 
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is <strong>Fr. Nov. 16, 2018</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F36908542%2F232427334571%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=800&amp;rect=0%2C149%2C1486%2C743&amp;s=11377e10a546a2aeb2884502bfaba381" alt="" /></p>

<p>The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA from <strong>October 9 - 10, 2018</strong>. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica Users’ Group (<a href="http://na.modelica-users.org/">NAMUG</a>).</p>

<p>Registration is open, with early bird discounts available through August 20th at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447">Eventbrite</a>.</p>

<p>This will be the first full Modelica conference to take place in North America, and will meet the high standards established by previous Modelica conferences. As such, this conference will share the latest scientific and industrial progress related to the Modelica modeling language and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI), and will be attended by a community of users, library developers, tool vendors, and researchers.  The call for papers resulted in over 40 submissions, which are currently being reviewed by the Program Committee, and will be presented in two tracks at the conference. The conference will also include an additional track of industrial user-oriented presentations, like those found at typical NAMUG events over the last 5 years, that are not accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts for these presentations will be peer-reviewed by the conference board.</p>

<p>An entertaining social program is also being planned for the conference, with a dinner cruise around the Boston harbor at end of the conference’s first day.  This cruise will afford excellent views of local landmarks, including the Seaport District and historic ships in the harbor, and will provide attendees with an opportunity to socialize and unwind in a picturesque setting.</p>

<h4 id="free-workshops-october-8th">Free Workshops: October 8th</h4>

<p>Thanks to the generous support from <a href="http://www.merl.com/">MERL</a> (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories), NAMUG will organize two <strong>free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th</strong> (before the conference). These workshops will take place at the MERL offices in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops, please select “Workshop Ticket” on the Eventbrite event page. There will be a <strong>beginner’s workshop</strong> in the morning, and advanced workshops in the afternoon: one with an introduction to <strong>modeling of thermo-fluid systems</strong> using applications from the Buildings Library and the second on <strong>physiology modeling</strong> using the Physiolibrary. To aid in planning, please register soon for these workshops since these workshops are conditional on interest and participation.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<h2 id="maplesim-2018-offers-new-tools-for-developing-digital-twins">MapleSim 2018 Offers New Tools for Developing Digital Twins</h2>
<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-02/41672707-99b6ed12-7488-11e8-86c1-841efeca6117.jpg" alt="MapleSim image" /></p>

<p>MapleSim 2018 family of products for system-level modeling expands modeling scope and improves toolchain connectivity.</p>

<p>Maplesoft™ has announced a new release of MapleSim™, the advanced system-level modeling tool. From digital twins for virtual commissioning to system-level models for complex engineering design projects, MapleSim helps organizations reduce development risk, lower costs, and enable innovation. The latest release provides new tools for developing digital twins, in addition to greater connectivity with other modeling tools, and expanded modeling scope.</p>

<p>MapleSim is used across a wide variety of applications and industries, including the creation of physics-based digital twins for virtual commissioning. Identifying the optimal motor size required to drive a mechanism is one of the most important goals of simulation with digital twins, and MapleSim 2018 provides tools that make this task easier. The new 1-D Motion Generation App allows engineers to create motion profiles that adhere to defined velocity and acceleration constraints. They can define the desired motion of the joints, and then run the simulation to discover the torques and forces required to create that motion.  This information can then be used to correctly size the motors, ensuring optimum performance at minimal cost.</p>

<p>MapleSim 2018 provides greater toolchain connectivity with the ability to import models from even more software tools.  With the expanded FMI support, engineers can import models defined using FMI 2.0 Fixed-Step Co-Simulation, as well as FMI Model Exchange. Other improvements include enhanced Modelica support for easy access to more 3rd party component libraries inside MapleSim. In addition, the MapleSim Heat Transfer Library from CYBERNET offers improved tools for studying heat transfer effects and preventing overheating, while the MapleSim Hydraulics Library™ from Modelon and MapleSim Pneumatics Library™ from Modelon add-ons can both now take into account temperature effects during simulations.</p>

<h2 id="score-application-simulation-for-everyone">Score Application - Simulation For Everyone</h2>
<p>The new <strong>XRG Score</strong> release enables multi-physics simulations by using the „Functional Mock-up Interface“ version 2.0. Score is supplied as an Microsoft Excel Add-in which makes the exchange of simulation data very easy. Simply everyone who has an Excel license can read, change or prepare values for simulation in the same file. This helps to deploy work from Modelica users to other colaborators.</p>

<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-02/XRG-Score-Figure.jpg" alt="XRG Score Add-in" title="XRG Score interaction with Excel and Dymola or FMU" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, the XRG Score transfers Dymola or OpenModelica results files and lets you filter and interpolate them. Score transfers parameter tables created in Excel to Dymola scripts and lets you start Dymola directly over an interface to run simulations and import the results. Our Score Application allows you to define and save all your simulation settings and any results you require in a workbook. You can run, import and report on any number of simulations over one of these workbooks. You can automatically transfer the results in Excel spreadsheet templates along with integrated charts and formulas.</p>

<p>More technical features of Score:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multi-Threading</strong> (parameter sweeps on multiple CPU cores)</li>
  <li><strong>Automatized</strong> simulation process</li>
  <li>Import, filtering and interpolation of complex result files (Dymola, FMU and OM) in Excel</li>
  <li>Template reports</li>
  <li>Broad support of MS Office versions through COM add-in</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="simcenter-amesim-161-provides-a-high-quality-support-of-the-functional-mock-up-interface-fmi">Simcenter Amesim 16.1 provides a high-quality support of the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)</h4>
<p><img src="https://newsletter.modelica.org/2018-02/Simcenter-Amesim-FMI.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Simcenter Amesim 16.1</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Complies with all existing discrete and continuous FMI 1.0 and 2.0 coupling modes.</li>
  <li>Can be used as master or integration platform for Functional Mock-up Unit (FMUs).</li>
  <li>Can manage multiple instantiations of the same FMU (if supported by the FMU itself).</li>
  <li>Can import and mix multiple FMUs: 1.0, 2.0, model exchange and co-simulation.</li>
  <li>Can export FMUs that support variable-step co-simulation.</li>
  <li>Can automatically generate a standardized HTML documentation for all its exported FMUs.</li>
  <li>Can generate “binary-only” FMUs embedding all the tables they need, for more IP protection and user-friendliness.</li>
  <li>Allows users to fine-tune which parameters and variables to be exposed by exported FMUs.</li>
  <li>Can export FMUs with both the 32-bit and the 64-bit binaries to ease model sharing via FMI.</li>
  <li>Exports co-simulation FMUs embedding all Simcenter Amesim solver capabilities: through dedicated exposed parameters, one can for instance switch 
from variable-step to fixed-step solver directly from the importing tool’s interface, with no need to re-export the FMU.</li>
  <li>Can export 2.0 FMUs for model exchange or co-simulation that provide their directional derivatives. 
Thus the recognized frequency analysis capabilities of Simcenter Amesim can be used within advanced master or importing environments.</li>
  <li>Can directly export “source-code FMUs” for specific FMI compatible multi-core real-time targets, which avoids the use of proprietary middleware 
to assemble the complete model, or create the real-time application.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More will come in future releases with other powerful FMI capabilities and usability improvements</strong>.
Stay tuned!</p>

<h4 id="model-creation">Model creation</h4>

<p>Dymola 2019 allows you to capture the parameters of existing components to create new models. This encourages the creation of specialized component libraries that can be used in subsequent designs.
Improved use of display units for parameters and variables in the graphical editor and in plots improves readability and reduces model ambiguity.</p>

<h4 id="simulation">Simulation</h4>

<p>To further support the simulation of hard thermo-fluid problems, Dymola 2019 has more robust and efficient handling of models with nonlinear equation systems through improved handling of initial values. Improved diagnostics at compilation and runtime helps find difficult numeric problems, and intermediate values can be checked during debugging.
Optimized handling of parameters helps minimize code generation for large tables of data, leading to faster model translation, simulation and post-processing.</p>

<h4 id="modelica-libraries">Modelica libraries</h4>

<p>Our libraries have seen the following enhancements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Battery Library: Version 2.1 includes a new pack model that enables the simulation of nested cylindrical cells. Additionally, the thermal model of the cylindrical cells is updated, allowing multiple surface heat ports for an improved simulation of heat distribution in discretized pack models.</li>
  <li>Hydrogen Library: Version 1.1 includes new media and component models for humidity control as well as a control based methane reformation model for PEM.</li>
  <li>Pneumatic Systems library is available in Dymola 2019, facilitating architecture design, component sizing, modeling and simulation of pneumatic systems.</li>

<p>The TIL Suite enables stationary and transient simulations. A new add-on “TIL AddOn Cabin” enriches the model portfolio of TIL:</p>

<p>The Cabin model enables the energy balancing of a cars single air volume and its surrounding components like walls, windows and built-in components. Furthermore, inner and outer thermal effects, the air conveyance separated in fresh and circulated air and the moisture ratio, influenced by the passengers’ water production are considered. Besides that, the human energy balance and the comfort level (PMV/PPD) will be calculated, based on a 1-node air cell model.</p>
