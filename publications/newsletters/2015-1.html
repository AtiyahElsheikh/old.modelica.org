<h2><a name="letter">Letter from the Board</a></h2>

<p> &nbsp; </p>

<p>
Dear Modelica and FMI interested,
</p>

<p>
<b>11th International Modelica Conference</b>: This conference, about Modelica and FMI, will take place on Sept. 21-23, 2015 near Paris. 
More than <em>400 participants</em> have already registered. For more details, <a href="2015-1/index_html.html#item382">see the conference newsletter article</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Modelica Success Story</b>: In the June 2015 issue of ITEA Magazine, an article was published entitled <a href="https://itea3.org/publication/download/itea-magazine-june-2015-21.pdf">ITEA Success Story Modelica</a> (pages 12-15). In this article the ITEA organization reports about the successful ITEA research projects in which Modelica and FMI have been further developed and introduced in industry.
</p>

<p>
<b>Modelica Standard Library</b>: A maintenance release was published on July 30, 2015 (Version 3.2.1 Build 3; for details see the 
<a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&milestone=MSL3.2.1%2Bbuild.3&group=component&max=200&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=id">trac tickets</a>).
</p>

<p><b>FMI</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The FMI project members discussed rules for how to develop and release new FMI versions. On April 2015 the FMI Steering Committee accepted and published the <a href="https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/docs/DevProcess/FMI_DevelopmentProcess_1.0.pdf">FMI Development Process</a>  document
and <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/development">templates for FCPs</a> (= FMI Change Proposals). In the meantime several working groups have been started to work on FMI enhancements according to this process.
</li>

<li>
All FCP contributors have to sign a CCLA (Corporate Contributor License Agreement). The CCLA text was initially proposed by IBM and is currently in a (nearly finished) negotiation phase between lawyers from several companies.
</li>

<li>
FMI logos for different purposes have been developed by a paid contract from a French company. The FMI group has already gotten the final design of the logos (in vector and bitmap graphics) and will make them publicly available once some final contractual details are fixed.
</li>

<li>
There are already more as <i>20 tools</i> that support <i>FMI 2.0</i>, the newest version of the FMI standard released in 2014 (for details see the <a href="https://fmi-standard.org/tools_FMI_2.0">Tools page</a> with filter "FMI_20").
</li>

<li>
The project leader, Torsten Blochwitz (ITI), will give an overview on the status of the FMI group in the <a href="2015-1/index_html.html#item336">FMI User Meeting</a> in the tutorial session of the Modelica conference.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Modelica</b>: The project members used the FMI Development Process as a starting point and adapted it to the needs for the Modelica Language Development. 
On June 2015 the <a href="https://svn.modelica.org/projects/MCP/public/ModelicaSpecification_DevelopmentProcess.pdf">Modelica Specification Development Process</a> was released together with <a href="https://svn.modelica.org/projects/MCP/public">MCP (Modelica Change Proposal) templates</a>. The Modelica web master already introduced a new component "--MCP--" and new milestones <em>MCP-XXX</em> into the <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&milestone=MCP-1-InDevelopment&group=component&max=200&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=id">trac system</a>. There are currently 18 MCP proposals in the <em>InDevelopment</em> phase.
</p>

<p>
<b>SSP</b>: (System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design): The SSP project started in 2014 and its members are very actively working on a new standard to describe the exchange of one or more connected FMUs with different parameter sets. The project leader, Jochen Köhler (ZF), will give a short overview on the status in the <a href="2015-1/index_html.html#item336">FMI User Meeting</a> in the tutorial session of the Modelica conference.
</p>

    <br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
    <p>
Hansjürg Wiesmann, 74, of Seegräben, Switzerland, passed away on August 22, 2015, as a result of a long struggle with a serious illness. We grieve the death of our beloved friend and Modelica Association member. Hansjürg was Senior Scientist at the ABB Research Center Baden, Switzerland during his professional career.  Also after his retirement he made valuable contributions to Modelica. His research topics included Theoretical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Dielectrics, and modelling of complex systems, for which he took part in the Modelica initiative since 1996. Hansjürg made many considerable contributions to the Modelica community such as the Modelica <a href="https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty/SPOT">SPOT</a> library for electric power systems which in turn is the basis of the <a href="https://github.com/modelica/PowerSystems">PowerSystems</a> and the <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/electric-power-library/">Electric Power Systems</a> library. He also authored and co-authored numerous scientific Modelica papers. Hansjürg was an outstanding scientist, and also a loyal and reliable person, whose calm spirit and integrity were prized within our Modelica community. His contributions to a good discussion culture at the Modelica design meetings will be missed by all of us. He is an inspiration to us and future generations of engineers.
</p>

<p>
We will miss him terribly and extend our condolences to his family.

       <img style="border:none" class="image-right" src="2015-1/images/FSL_338_190_Name2.png" alt="New Fuel System Library" />
    
    <p>
Modelon is now publically releasing the Fuel System Library for the first time. Fuel System Library is a Modelica model library targeting the design and verification of fuel systems on civil and military aircraft. It is designed to analyze and verify the system behavior during various dynamic operating modes and flight conditions. Aircraft are characterized by large variations in acceleration and orientation. The Fuel System Library provides simulation results accounting for these effects on fuel-air mixtures and includes full support of bidirectional flow.
</p>

<p>
Fuel System Library is a suitable tool for system and component development and enables an assessment of system performance and transient characteristics. It has been developed internally at Modelon since a number of years together with a European airframer. Starting with version 3.1, it is now publically available. Modelon are now able to offer a package hardened through industrial program deployment out of the box.
</p>

<p>
The models have been designed to be efficient and numerically robust and can therefore handle large-scale complex systems. Component models include ejectors, pumps, tanks, valves, and pipes.
</p>

<p>
Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexible composition of user-defined system architectures for efficient model management,</li> 
<li>Geometric models with arbitrary gravity and acceleration for accurate predictions throughout the entire flight envelope,</li>
<li>Real-time capable high performance models enabling Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) applications,</li>
<li>Full support for bidirectional flow for coverage of all operating conditions,</li>
<li>Efficient representation of air-fuel mixture properties enabling robust and fast simulation of large systems, and</li>
<li>Configurable model fidelity, such as switching on or off the thermal effects, for faster simulation and right complexity</li>
</ul>

<p>

    <p>
Modelon is pleased to announce the public release of the Environmental Control Library, a Modelica model library for aircraft environmental control systems analysis and design. The library is designed to study energy consumption and thermal conditions that affect the level of comfort for passengers and crew. These performance aspects are driven by large variations in ambient conditions such as humidity and temperature. The models provided by Environmental Control Library account for these effects through first principles and fully support bidirectional flow.
</p>

<p>
Environmental Control Library is used in system and component development and assists in the assessment of system performance and transient characteristics. Since a number of years it has been developed by Modelon together with a European airframer. It is now publically available in version 3.1 and provides value hardened through industrial program deployment.

    <p>The <a href="http://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/xrg-library/humancomfort">HumanComfort Library</a> is a Modelica library for modelling the thermal behaviour of buildings, as well as vehicle, ship and aircraft cabins. It allows simultaneous dynamic simulation of zones and air conditioning systems, as the new <b>HumanComfort Library 2.0</b> includes the addition of a <b>CFD-based</b> air model. Using view factors, an exact calculation of the thermal radiation between visible surfaces is supported. The new model uses the finite-volume method to subdivide the air volume, making it possible to reduce the number of required cells. The calculation is made on the basis of Navier-Stokes equations, which achieves conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>With simultaneous simulation of air-conditioned zones (e.g. in buildings and 
vehicles) and the air-conditioning system, it is possible to draw up an analysis of the interactions between the system and the comfort in the zone. The effects of, for example, brief system failures can thus be examined in a cost-saving and time-efficient way.</p>
<p>The new CFD package has been verfied and validated successfully against multiple measurements (e.g., aircraft and automotive cabins). It will be released in HumanComfort Library 2.0 in November 2015. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@ltx.de">info@ltx.de</a> or your local Dymola distributor for more info.</p>

    <p>
With the last releases of <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/hydraulics-library/">Hydraulics Library </a> we introduce consolidated modeling capabilities in ThermoHydraulics, as well as improved documentation and tutorials.
</p>
<h4>Thermo Hydraulics</h4>
<p>
With the introduction of gas content ThermoHydraulics performance is now numerically more robust. 
</p>
<p>
You will find that parameterizing using tables is now faster, since tables can be inserted directly in the media definition. It is easy to see the influence of thermodynamic effects since they can be switched off directly in the oil parameter-interface. This new feature also enables usage of ThermoHydraulics-fluids in isothermal applications. Compared to the previous tabular fluids, these fluids reduce simulation time with a factor of approximately five.
</p>
<p>Read Modelon's <a href="http://www.modelon.com/entry/hydraulics-library-41-adds-new-thermodynamic-effects/">blog article </a>to see an interesting application example on ThermoHydraulics! 
</p>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>The recent documentation improvements have been focused on enabling to find relevant information for experienced and new users. Both top level and component specific information have been reworked. The library comes with brand new tutorials  for the Lines, Elements and Fluids sub-packages, assisting you with choices for your application. Additionally, you will find increased guidance for the parametrization and assumptions of components in the dialog boxes and documentation.</p>
<h4>Specialized courses</h4>
<p>Get a head start with the Hydraulics Library by attending our new specialized <a href="http://www.modelon.com/training/introduction-courses-modelica-libraries/hydraulics-library-introduction-course/">course</a>, designed for both beginners and power users. </p>

    <p>The latest versions of <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/heat-exchanger-library/">Heat Exchanger Library </a> add to the existing models for stackable flat tube heat exchangers, models for configurable plate heat exchangers and for condensers with in-built receiver.</p>

<h4>Plate heat exchangers</h4>

<p>All flow configurations can be captured in the plate heat exchanger model: different plate arrangements and overall relative flow direction. We have included two different plate geometries: plain and chevron, as well as corresponding heat transfer and pressure drop correlations. The modular nature of the models permits to conventiently add new geometries and correlations.</p>

<h4>Condenser with receiver</h4>
<p>The condenser with in-built receiver contains all functionalities of the flat tube heat exchangers – you can use it in stacks, with inhomogeneous flows and specify geometry specific correlations. You can configure it in various ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Place the receiver after any pass   </li>
<li>Initialize with enthalpy or predefined liquid level</li>
<li>Add dessicant to the receiver</li>
</ul>

       <img style="border:none" class="image-right" src="2015-1/images/VDL_338_190_Name_1.png" alt="Vehicle Dynamics Library 2.2 - Improved ground interaction" />
    
    <p>Recent developments in <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/vehicle-dynamics-library/">Vehicle Dynamics Library</a>  have been focused on improved ground interaction.</p>


<h4> OpenCRG&reg; ground </h4>

<p>The OpenCRG&reg;  project provides open file formats and open source tools for the detailed description and evaluation of 3D road surfaces. OpenCRG&reg;  data sets are designed to describe very detailed patches of road surfaces making them suitable for a broad range of applications including e.g. tire and driving simulations. The OpenCRG&reg;  ground model supports both binary and textual OpenCRG® data files. </p>

<h4> Cornering ground </h4>

<p>This ground model allows modification of the ground surface position, orientation and curvature based on input signals. This ground model can be used in quasi-steady state simulations to evaluate chassis states at a particular straight line or cornering condition. The chassis velocity and curvature result in lateral, longitudinal and vertical accelerations being applied to the vehicle. This ground model is particularly useful in motorsports applications to evaluate chassis states at different points on the race track. </p>

<h4>New strut components</h4>
<p>New strut components with bushings have been introduced. These struts are mounted to the chassis and suspension with a bushing. The bushing components are replaceable, and one model has two sets of translational flanges where one can be parameterized to attach either inside or outside the mount bushings. This is useful when springs and dampers are co-located in the suspension but attached on different sides of the mount bushings.</p>


<h4> Planar contact </h4>
<p>A planar contact calculation filtering method has been added to the Generic contact calculation block. The planar filtering method calculates a center frame and contact frame based on a plane on the ground surface. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/vehicle-dynamics-library/">Vehicle Dynamics Library</a> provides architecture and contents for full vehicle dynamics. Applications cover optimization, offline simulation, driver simulators, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). </p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/air-conditioning-library/">Air Conditioning Library</a> is Modelon's long-standing thermofluid modeling library. Its improvements for the last releases are concentrated along two axes : improved numerics for zero flow behaviour and user convenience.</p>
<p>
The newly added system component reassembles the controls to adjust your model for simulations with little or no mass flow. All settings are automatically propagated to your thermofluid components.  In addition, the library's connectors have been upgraded to stream connectors, resulting in increased zero-flow performance. Settings include:  
</p>


<ul>
<li>various differentiating schemes,  </li>
<li>state selection,</li>
<li>event generation,</li>
<li>and the possibility to shut-off pressure loss models.</li>
</ul>

<p>The library's reviewed and extended documentation is intended for new users as well as power users. New users will be able to rapidly familiarize with the library. Power users are given an insight in modelling techniques.</p>

    <p>
LBNL released version 2.1 of the Modelica Buildings library, a free open-source library with dynamic simulation models for building energy and control systems. The library contains more than 600 models, blocks and functions for 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
air-based HVAC systems, 
</li>
<li>
chilled water plants, 
</li>
<li>
water-based heating systems, 
</li>
<li>
controls, 
</li>
<li>
heat transfer among rooms and the outside, 
</li>
<li>
multizone airflow, including natural ventilation and contaminant transport,
</li>
<li>
single-zone computational fluid dynamics coupled to heat transfer and HVAC systems, 
</li>
<li>
data-driven load prediction for demand response applications, and 
</li>
<li>
electrical DC and AC systems with two- or three-phases that can be balanced and unbalanced. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Buildings library is based on the Annex 60 library, a free open-source library with basic models that codify best practices for the implementation of models for building and community energy and control systems. The Annex 60 library is developed within the <a href="http://www.iea-annex60.org"> Annex 60</a> project of the International Energy Agency's Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme.
</p>
<p>
The recent major additions to the Buildings library are 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The model 
<a href="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v2.1.0/help/Buildings_Rooms.html#Buildings.Rooms.CFD">Buildings.Rooms.CFD</a>
that embeds a CFD model inside a thermal zone. The CFD model is an implementation of the Fast Fluid Dynamics code that allows three-dimensional CFD inside a thermal zone, coupled to building heat transfer, HVAC components and feedback control loops.
</li>
<li>
The package 
<a href="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v2.1.0/help/Buildings_Electrical.html">Buildings.Electrical</a>
which allows simulation of buildings to electrical grid integration. It includes models for loads, transformers, cables, batteries, PVs and wind turbines. Models exist for DC and AC systems with two- or three-phases that can be balanced and unbalanced.

       <img style="border:none" class="image-right" src="2015-1/images/cvt_screenshot_smaller.png" alt="Virtual Prototyping with VPS and Modelica" />
    
    <p><a href="http://www.esi-group.com/software-services/virtual-performance/virtual-performance-solution">VPS</a> (Virtual Performance Solution) is <a href="http://www.esi-group.com">ESI-Group</a>'s solution for Virtual Product Engineering, which has its origins in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAM-CRASH">PAM-CRASH</a>, and takes into account multiple domains. Applications of VPS include crash and safety for automotive and other industries; powertrain dynamics; NVH and comfort.</p>

<p>Co-simulation between the finite element method solvers of VPS and Modelica forms part of the new ESI-Xplorer product line, enabling high-fidelity Virtual Prototyping of systems combining 3D mechanical subsystems with electrical, hydraulics, controls and other domains supported by Modelica. ESI-Group solutions utilise a shared Visual platform for model assembly and post-processing, which enables convenient assembly of the combined model and analysis of the simulation results.</p>

<p>A specific use-case of this solution is a VPS model of the mechanical variator in a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), co-simulating with a Modelica model of the control system and hydraulic system. The CVT variator comprises a push-belt, made up of separate plates; and primary and secondary cone pulleys. The VPS model captures the interaction between these mechanical elements including the complex friction between the belt and pulleys. Each pulley is actuated by a hydraulic piston, the pressure of which is controlled to achieve the desired ratio. The Modelica model captures the dynamics of the hydraulic and control system. During execution of the co-simulation the interactions between the mechanical, hydraulic and control elements are simulated. The effects of design parameters and control algorithms on the overall system dynamics can be studied and optimized.</p>

<p>This solution and case study will be presented in detail at the <a href="http://www.nafems.org/events/nafems/2015/eur-mbs/">NAFEMS Coupled MBS-FE Applications</a> conference in Turin, Italy, 20th-21st October 2015.</p>

       <img style="border:none" class="image-right" src="2015-1/images/Modellica-Newsletter_TL_400x400px_RGB.png" alt="dSPACE TargetLink Supports FMI 2.0 Exports" />
    
    <p>
The new version of the dSPACE production code generator, <a href="http://www.dspace.com/goto?TargetLink">TargetLink&reg;</a> 4.1, now has a key enhancement – it supports the FMI standard. This standard is used as the basis for taking production software code generated by TargetLink and exporting it as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). Based on MATLAB&reg;/Simulink&reg;/Stateflow, TargetLink translates models into ANSI C code integrated directly in the electronic control units. TargetLink supports the generation of both conventional and AUTOSAR-compliant code.
</p>
<p>  
With TargetLink 4.1, FMUs based on the FMI 2.0 for Co-Simulation standard can now be exported directly from Simulink/TargetLink models. These FMUs encapsulate the TargetLink-generated production code and can therefore be integrated and simulated in all environments that suitably support the FMI standard. This can be done for real-time and non-real-time simulation platforms. As a result, software developers can create production code software in a familiar development environment and then import and reuse it in different environments without any manual effort.
</p>
<p>
Please visit the <a href="http://www.dspace.com/goto?fmi">dSPACE FMI</a> website for more information about the dSPACE FMI support and the <a href="http://www.dspace.com/goto?TargetLink">dSPACE TargetLink</a> website for more information about TargetLink.

    <h2><a name="item338">New Product from Maplesoft Offers Easy Web Deployment of MapleSim Simulations</a></h2>
    
    <br /> &nbsp; <br />

    
       <img style="border:none" class="image-right" src="2015-1/images/MapleSim2015_Core.png" alt="New Product from Maplesoft Offers Easy Web Deployment of MapleSim Simulations" />
    
    <p>Maplesoft™ recently announced the release of MapleSim™ 2015 and the latest member of the MapleSim family of products, MapleSim Server. MapleSim is an advanced system-level modeling and simulation platform from Maplesoft, and the MapleSim Server is a new product that allows engineers to explore MapleSim simulation models from a web browser.</p>

<p>MapleSim offers a modern approach to physical modeling and simulation, dramatically reducing model development and analysis time while producing fast, high-fidelity simulations. MapleSim supports the creation of easy-to-use interactive applications that allow engineers to access, analyze, and explore simulation models. With the MapleSim Server, these applications can then be shared with other engineers in the organization, even if they do not have MapleSim. Using only a standard web browser, engineers can perform a wide variety of tasks, including changing parameters, manipulating model equations, running new simulations, and viewing updated results. By using the MapleSim Server, organizations can easily make these solutions available to more people while fully controlling access and eliminating version control problems.</p>

<p>“Solution deployment is a critical piece of the engineering process in any organization, and one that frequently causes logistical headaches unrelated to the actual solution of the engineering problem,” says Paul Goossens, Vice President of Application Engineering at Maplesoft. “The MapleSim Server saves organizations both time and money by providing a mechanism that allows the organization to take the engineering solution developed in MapleSim and deploy it directly to other engineers over the web. This makes the solution available quickly, and avoids the complications that come from having to convert a solution to another tool, pass around individual files which get out of date, or buy additional software for every single engineer who might need it.”</p>

<p>The MapleSim Server is part of the MapleSim 2015 family of products. MapleSim itself has also been enhanced to include powerful new tools that help engineers manage large models efficiently. Engineers can now search their model to determine which components reference a particular parameter, find all occurrences of a particular component or component type, and see exactly where a lookup table is used in a model. MapleSim 2015 also generates help pages automatically from custom components in a shared library, simplifies the updating of common properties shared by multiple components, and supports Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1, the latest official release of this international standard. </p>

Also, Dr. Schmitke will be hosting a tutorial: Working with Maple 2015. Both of these will take place on Monday September 21st. </p>

<p>Visitors to the Maplesoft booth will get a chance to see the latest improvements in MapleSim. MapleSim 2015 includes powerful new tools for managing large models more efficiently, as well as updated Modelica support, new and updated components, more connectivity with Maple, and a variety of interface enhancements requested by customers.</p>

<p>MapleSim, the advanced system-level modeling and simulation tool from Maplesoft, is a Modelica-based tool that applies modern techniques to dramatically reduce development time, provide greater insight into system behaviour, and produce fast, high-fidelity simulations. The combination of the Modelica modeling language with the symbolic computation power of MapleSim enables a level of understanding, power, and extensibility that is not possible with “black-box” tools. </p>

    <p>
To serve the needs of its industrial customers, Siemens&nbsp;PLM&nbsp;Software promotes the deployment of the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) 
as a reliable standard for exchanging models of dynamic systems. This is already reflected in the recently released version 
of its 1D system simulation flagship product, LMS&nbsp;Imagine.Lab&nbsp;Amesim&trade;&nbsp;14.1. 
</p>
<p>
While LMS&nbsp;Amesim as FMI&nbsp;2.0 co-simulation <i>master</i> platform has already passed the official FMI Cross Checks in March 2015, with version 15, 
models will also be exportable as 2.0 <i>slave</i> Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) for co-simulation. LMS&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;14.1 has the key competitive advantage 
to transparently manage causal or acausal modeling approaches. This is also the case with its FMI export capabilities that can be used with Modelica models 
or with its native models indifferently. 
</p>
<p>
Siemens&nbsp;PLM&nbsp;Software currently works on many other exciting improvements that leverage the best of the FMI standard: 
<ul>
<li> Capability to generate real-time capable FMUs to be executed on FMI compliant targets.
<li> One-click generation of FMUs usable both on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, no matter if under Linux or Windows. 
<li> Automatic mechanism for embedding model tables, making FMUs usable anywhere, always with all the required model dependencies. 
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
The Siemens PLM team is looking forward to discussing our products at the upcoming Modelica Conference in Versailles, France.  We will be presenting the LMS&nbsp;Amesim Modelica platform and FMI tools during the <a href="../../events/modelica2015/program-content.html#vendor-sessions">vendor sessions</a>.  Participants will see the latest features available in LMS&nbsp;Imagine.Lab&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;14.1, as well as get an advanced preview of developments underway for LMS&nbsp;Imagine.Lab&nbsp;Amesim&nbsp;15.
</p>

that transforms FMI compliant models (FMUs) into web-based
applications.  Come see us on Monday, September 21st at 5:00pm in the "Colbert" room
at the Modelica Conference.
</p>

<p>
One of the big advantages of XenGen is that it builds web-based
applications based on information already contained in the FMUs.
First, it leverages as much of the information already contained in an
FMU as possible (min values, max values, defaults values,
units, <i>etc.</i>).  When additional information is required beyond
what is normally provided by FMI, it leverages a simple and intuitive
markup language to provide additional information and/or hints about
how to display and manage data.  In this way, model developers work
with <b>the tools they already know</b> and <b>no knowledge of
HTML, Javascript or CSS</b> is required to create these web
applications.
</p>

<p>
With XenGen, model developers have a simple way to deploy and update
their models.  The main benefit of XenGen is that existing models
can <b>easily be transformed into web applications that can be used
by many more users</b>.  By leveraging reactive design, these
applications can be used on devices such as tablets and phones as
well.  This greatly expands the impact and reach of these models.
This, in turn, means a much better return on the investment made in
creating these models.
</p>

<p>
In addition to being a model deployment platform, <b>XenGen is also a
data management platform</b>.  It provides a complete data management
solution for designs and simulation results.  Furthermore, the
underlying data management system is also a collaboration platform
allowing users to exchange designs and results with each other as
easily as sharing a simple hyperlink.
</p>

<p>
Xogeny will be demonstrating the XenGen application generator during
the Xogeny vendor session.  Please stop by and see XenGen in action.
