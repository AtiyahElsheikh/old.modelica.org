Computer Associates International, Inc. Cosmo Player License and Distribution 
Agreement

	Before you download the computer Program(s) identified above (the 
	"Program(s)"), we need to establish what you can expect from us, 
	Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA") and what we expect from 
	you.  By entering into this Agreement with CA, you will be given certain 
	rights to bundle or integrate the Program(s) into computer program(s) 
	that you license to others and subject to certain restrictions with 
	respect to the use and distribution of the Program(s).  If you agree 
	with what you read below and are authorized by your company to enter 
	into this Agreement, complete the on-line registration form, then click 
	the "I Accept" button on our final screen and proceed to download the 
	Program(s).  We will then have an agreement in place governing your 
	rights and our obligations with respect to the Program(s).  If you do 
	not agree with what you read below, then do not proceed any further and 
	do not click the "I Accept" button.  If you have any questions about 
	this Agreement, send us an e-mail at cosmosoftware@platinum.com and we 
	will try to respond to your questions. 

LICENSE

	CA grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and non-
	transferable license to promote, market, reproduce and distribute the 
	unaltered Program(s), directly or through other resellers, but solely as 
	integrated into or bundled with your computer program which adds 
	substantial added value to the Program(s) (the "Bundled Program").  You 
	may not distribute the Program on a stand-alone basis, except as an 
	upgrade to existing licensees of the Bundled Program. 

	You will ensure that as part of the set up and installation procedure 
	for the Bundled Program, the end user is presented with CA's then 
	current on-screen license agreement/ a valid on-screen license agreement 
	not materially inconsistent with the usage rights and obligations 
	contained in this Agreement requiring the end user to accept the terms 
	prior to installation of the Program(s).  You will also ensure that each 
	reseller authorized by you to distribute the Program(s) as part of the 
	Bundled Program(s) has a valid agreement in place with you that it is at 
	least as protective of CA's rights in the Program(s) as are contained in 
	this Agreement.    

	As part of this Agreement, CA may from time to time provide updates to 
	the Program(s) via its website.  Such updates will not include any major 
	improvements which CA generally makes available for a separate charge.  
	You agree to use your reasonable efforts to cease reproduction and 
	distribution of older versions of the Program(s) that have been 
	superseded by an update and to promptly incorporate the updated 
	Program(s) into the Bundled Program(s).  You may deplete your existing 
	inventory of Bundled Program(s) including the superseded Program(s), 
	provided that you notify end users of such Program(s) in writing that 
	updated versions of the Program(s) are available for downloading on the 
	CA website.  CA has no obligation to develop or distribute any updates 
	as part of this Agreement.

OWNERSHIP

The Program(s) are protected by national copyright laws and international 
copyright treaties.  The source code of the Program(s) are protected as a trade 
secret.  CA and/or its licensors retain all proprietary rights in or related to 
the Program(s).  You are granted only the limited rights specified in this 
Agreement with respect to the object code versions of the Program(s). 

	You agree to faithfully reproduce all copyright notices and other 
	proprietary legends contained in the Program(s) on each copy of the 
	Program(s) that you license as part of the Bundled Program.  You may use 
	the CA trademarks and logos identified in the attached schedule in your 
	marketing and promotional literature for the Bundled Program, provided 
	that you make a copy of such materials available to CA for approval 
	prior to such use and that you do not assert any rights or interests 
	inconsistent with CA's ownership of such trademarks and logos.  You 
	agree not to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Program(s), 
	except as and to the extent that applicable law may allow you to do so 
	despite this restriction.

COPIES AND REPORTS

	At least 10 days prior to your first shipment or distribution of each 
	new Bundled Program, or any major upgrade, you will provide CA with a 
	royalty-free copy of such Bundled Program for CA's inspection and 
	approval.  If CA determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the 
	distribution of the Bundled Product with the Program(s) is materially 
	inconsistent with CA's interest, CA will promptly notify you and you 
	agree not to ship or distribute such Bundled Product with the Program(s) 
	or use any CA trademark or logo in connection with such Bundled Program.  
	Upon your request, CA will destroy such evaluation copy of the Bundled 
	Program.

	You agree to provide CA with monthly reports of all Bundled Program(s) 
	licensed to end users directly or through your resellers indicating the 
	names and quantities of Bundled Program(s) shipped or otherwise 
	distributed in the preceding month.  You agree that upon reasonable 
	prior notice CA may inspect your books and records and computer 
	equipment solely to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

	To the best of CA's knowledge, without duty to investigate, the 
	Program(s) do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any other 
	person.  As CA makes the Program(s) available on a royalty-free basis, 
	you accept the Program(s) "AS-IS", with no warranty of any kind.  CA 
	does not warrant that the Program(s) will be error-free or operate in an 
	uninterrupted manner.

	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, CA MAKES NO WARRANTY OR 
	CONDITION, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM(S), AND 
	SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, TITLE AND NON-
	INFRINGEMENT.  YOU AND YOUR END USERS ACCEPT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
	RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM(S) AND BUNDLED PROGRAM(S).

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CA, ITS LICENSORS OR RELATED PERSONS BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, WHETHER 
FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, BASED ON YOUR CLAIMS OR THOSE OF YOUR RESELLERS OR 
CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, PROFITS, USE OF MONEY, 
COMPUTERS OR THE PROGRAM(S), INTERRUPTION IN THE USE OR AVAILABILITY OF DATA, 
STOPPAGE OF WORK OR OTHER IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS), ARISING OUT OF BREACH OR 
FAILURE OF WARRANTY OR REMEDY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION, 
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR OTHERWISE.  IN NO EVENT WILL CA'S, ITS 
LICENSORS' OR RELATED PERSONS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS 
IN THE AGGREGATE.  THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY ONLY IF AND TO 
THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES LIABILITY BEYOND AND DESPITE THIS 
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION.

TERM AND TERMINATION

	This Agreement becomes effective upon your acceptance for an initial 
	term of one year, and will automatically renew for successive one year 
	periods, unless either you or CA provides notice of its intent to 
	terminate at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial term 
	or any renewal term.  CA may terminate this Agreement immediately upon 
	notice to you if you breach any term of this Agreement that remains 
	uncured for 30 days after receipt of CA's notice of default.

	Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, you and your 
	resellers must cease reproduction and distribution of the Program(s) and 
	all use of the CA trademarks, and destroy all copies of the Program and 
	information designated by CA as confidential in your possession or 
	control.  Unless CA has terminated this Agreement for your uncured 
	breach, you may continue to license your existing inventory of Bundled 
	Program(s) with the Program(s) on hand on the date of expiration or 
	termination for a period not to exceed 90 days.  Expiration or 
	termination of this Agreement will not affect any previously authorized 
	licenses of the Program(s) granted by you or your resellers to end 
	users.

	trade embargo by the U.S. Government.  You agree not to download or 
	otherwise export or re-export the Program(s) or related technical data,
