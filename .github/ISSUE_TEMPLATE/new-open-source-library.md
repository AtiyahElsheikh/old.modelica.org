We would like to have https://github.com/<!-- OurOrganization -->/<!-- LibraryName--> listed on modelica.org/libraries.

<!--
Note that the library listing depends on the GitHub API which means you need to keep a git repository on GitHub updated in order to be listed on the web page.
The listing works by forking your repository to https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty and keeping the mirror updated.
This ticket is closed when the mirroring is setup.
After that it may take up to 24 hours before the webpage is updated.

<!--
For commercial libraries, create a pull request modifying
https://github.com/modelica/old.modelica.org/blob/master/libraries.html
instead of creating an issue.
